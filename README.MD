# You Don't Know JS (book series) in Vim doc!

![YDKJS inside Vim](/images/ydkjs.jpg)

This is the awesome series of books diving deep into the core mechanisms of the JavaScript language, written by Kyle Simpson, made available right at your fingertips in Vim documentation.


## How it works:

Simply type *:help ydkjs.txt* to open in a buffer the entire book. All the contents are available, you can easily jump to the section you are looking for by selecting the chapter in the index.

Vim documentation doesn't support all the available syntax highlighting that markdown does, but we can have title formattinge, highlighting, inline code like, and also a basic but useful code formatting.
