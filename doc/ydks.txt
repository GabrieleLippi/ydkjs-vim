You Don't Know JS: Up & Going~
Chapter 1: Into Programming~                              *IntoProgramming*

Welcome to the *You Don't Know JS* (*YDKJS*) series.
*Up & Going* is an introduction to several basic concepts of programming -- of course we lean toward JavaScript (often abbreviated JS) specifically -- and how to approach and understand the rest of the titles in this series. Especially if you're just getting into programming and/or JavaScript, this book will briefly explore what you need to get *up and going*.
This book starts off explaining the basic principles of programming at a very high level. It's mostly intended if you are starting *YDKJS* with little to no prior programming experience, and are looking to these books to help get you started along a path to understanding programming through the lens of JavaScript.
Chapter 1 should be approached as a quick overview of the things you'll want to learn more about and practice to get *into programming*. There are also many other fantastic programming introduction resources that can help you dig into these topics further, and I encourage you to learn from them in addition to this chapter.
Once you feel comfortable with general programming basics, Chapter 2 will help guide you to a familiarity with JavaScript's flavor of programming. Chapter 2 introduces what JavaScript is about, but again, it's not a comprehensive guide -- that's what the rest of the *YDKJS* books are for!
If you're already fairly comfortable with JavaScript, first check out Chapter 3 as a brief glimpse of what to expect from *YDKJS*, then jump right in!

Code~
Let's start from the beginning.
A program, often referred to as *source code* or just *code*, is a set of special instructions to tell the computer what tasks to perform. Usually code is saved in a text file, although with JavaScript you can also type code directly into a developer console in a browser, which we'll cover shortly.
The rules for valid format and combinations of instructions is called a *computer language*, sometimes referred to as its *syntax*, much the same as English tells you how to spell words and how to create valid sentences using words and punctuation.

Statements~
In a computer language, a group of words, numbers, and operators that performs a specific task is a *statement*. In JavaScript, a statement might look as follows:
>
  a = b * 2;

The characters `a` and `b` are called *variables* (see "Variables"), which are like simple boxes you can store any of your stuff in. In programs, variables hold values (like the number `42`) to be used by the program. Think of them as symbolic placeholders for the values themselves.
By contrast, the `2` is just a value itself, called a *literal value*, because it stands alone without being stored in a variable.
The `=` and `*` characters are *operators* (see "Operators") -- they perform actions with the values and variables such as assignment and mathematic multiplication.
Most statements in JavaScript conclude with a semicolon (`;`) at the end.
The statement `a = b * 2;` tells the computer, roughly, to get the current value stored in the variable `b`, multiply that value by `2`, then store the result back into another variable we call `a`.
Programs are just collections of many such statements, which together describe all the steps that it takes to perform your program's purpose.

Expressions~
Statements are made up of one or more *expressions*. An expression is any reference to a variable or value, or a set of variable(s) and value(s) combined with operators.
For example:
>
  a = b * 2;

This statement has four expressions in it:
* `2` is a *literal value expression*
* `b` is a *variable expression*, which means to retrieve its current value
* `b * 2` is an *arithmetic expression*, which means to do the multiplication
* `a = b * 2` is an *assignment expression*, which means to assign the result of the `b * 2` expression to the variable `a` (more on assignments later)
A general expression that stands alone is also called an *expression statement*, such as the following:
>
  b * 2;

This flavor of expression statement is not very common or useful, as generally it wouldn't have any effect on the running of the program -- it would retrieve the value of `b` and multiply it by `2`, but then wouldn't do anything with that result.
A more common expression statement is a *call expression* statement (see "Functions"), as the entire statement is the function call expression itself:
>
  alert( a );

Executing a Program~
How do those collections of programming statements tell the computer what to do? The program needs to be *executed*, also referred to as *running the program*.
Statements like `a = b * 2` are helpful for developers when reading and writing, but are not actually in a form the computer can directly understand. So a special utility on the computer (either an *interpreter* or a *compiler*) is used to translate the code you write into commands a computer can understand.
For some computer languages, this translation of commands is typically done from top to bottom, line by line, every time the program is run, which is usually called *interpreting* the code.
For other languages, the translation is done ahead of time, called *compiling* the code, so when the program *runs* later, what's running is actually the already compiled computer instructions ready to go.
It's typically asserted that JavaScript is *interpreted*, because your JavaScript source code is processed each time it's run. But that's not entirely accurate. The JavaScript engine actually *compiles* the program on the fly and then immediately runs the compiled code.
Note: For more information on JavaScript compiling, see the first two chapters of the *Scope & Closures* title of this series.

Try It Yourself~
This chapter is going to introduce each programming concept with simple snippets of code, all written in JavaScript (obviously!).
It cannot be emphasized enough: while you go through this chapter -- and you may need to spend the time to go over it several times -- you should practice each of these concepts by typing the code yourself. The easiest way to do that is to open up the developer tools console in your nearest browser (Firefox, Chrome, IE, etc.).
Tip: Typically, you can launch the developer console with a keyboard shortcut or from a menu item. For more detailed information about launching and using the console in your favorite browser, see "Mastering The Developer Tools Console" (http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/mastering-developer-tools-console). To type multiple lines into the console at once, use `<shift> + <enter>` to move to the next new line. Once you hit `<enter>` by itself, the console will run everything you've just typed.
Let's get familiar with the process of running code in the console. First, I suggest opening up an empty tab in your browser. I prefer to do this by typing `about:blank` into the address bar. Then, make sure your developer console is open, as we just mentioned.
Now, type this code and see how it runs:
>
  a = 21;
  b = a * 2;
  console.log( b );

Typing the preceding code into the console in Chrome should produce something like the following:
Go on, try it. The best way to learn programming is to start coding!

Output~
In the previous code snippet, we used `console.log(..)`. Briefly, let's look at what that line of code is all about.
You may have guessed, but that's exactly how we print text (aka *output* to the user) in the developer console. There are two characteristics of that statement that we should explain.
First, the `log( b )` part is referred to as a function call (see "Functions"). What's happening is we're handing the `b` variable to that function, which asks it to take the value of `b` and print it to the console.
Second, the `console.` part is an object reference where the `log(..)` function is located. We cover objects and their properties in more detail in Chapter 2.
Another way of creating output that you can see is to run an `alert(..)` statement. For example:
>
  alert( b );

If you run that, you'll notice that instead of printing the output to the console, it shows a popup "OK" box with the contents of the `b` variable. However, using `console.log(..)` is generally going to make learning about coding and running your programs in the console easier than using `alert(..)`, because you can output many values at once without interrupting the browser interface.
For this book, we'll use `console.log(..)` for output.

Input~
While we're discussing output, you may also wonder about *input* (i.e., receiving information from the user).
The most common way that happens is for the HTML page to show form elements (like text boxes) to a user that they can type into, and then using JS to read those values into your program's variables.
But there's an easier way to get input for simple learning and demonstration purposes such as what you'll be doing throughout this book. Use the `prompt(..)` function:
>
  age = prompt( "Please tell me your age:" );
  console.log( age );

As you may have guessed, the message you pass to `prompt(..)` -- in this case, `"Please tell me your age:"` -- is printed into the popup.
This should look similar to the following:
<img src="fig2.png" width="500">
Once you submit the input text by clicking "OK," you'll observe that the value you typed is stored in the `age` variable, which we then *output* with `console.log(..)`:
<img src="fig3.png" width="500">
To keep things simple while we're learning basic programming concepts, the examples in this book will not require input. But now that you've seen how to use `prompt(..)`, if you want to challenge yourself you can try to use input in your explorations of the examples.

Operators~
Operators are how we perform actions on variables and values. We've already seen two JavaScript operators, the `=` and the `*`.
The `*` operator performs mathematic multiplication. Simple enough, right?
The `=` equals operator is used for *assignment* -- we first calculate the value on the *right-hand side* (source value) of the `=` and then put it into the variable that we specify on the *left-hand side* (target variable).
Warning: This may seem like a strange reverse order to specify assignment. Instead of `a = 42`, some might prefer to flip the order so the source value is on the left and the target variable is on the right, like `42 -> a` (this is not valid JavaScript!). Unfortunately, the `a = 42` ordered form, and similar variations, is quite prevalent in modern programming languages. If it feels unnatural, just spend some time rehearsing that ordering in your mind to get accustomed to it.
Consider:
>
  a = 2;
  b = a + 1;

Here, we assign the `2` value to the `a` variable. Then, we get the value of the `a` variable (still `2`), add `1` to it resulting in the value `3`, then store that value in the `b` variable.
While not technically an operator, you'll need the keyword `var` in every program, as it's the primary way you *declare* (aka *create*) *var*iables (see "Variables").
You should always declare the variable by name before you use it. But you only need to declare a variable once for each *scope* (see "Scope"); it can be used as many times after that as needed. For example:
>
  var a = 20;
  a = a + 1;
  a = a * 2;
  console.log( a );	// 42

Here are some of the most common operators in JavaScript:
* Assignment: `=` as in `a = 2`.
* Math: `+` (addition), `-` (subtraction), `*` (multiplication), and `/` (division), as in `a * 3`.
* Compound Assignment: `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, and `/=` are compound operators that combine a math operation with assignment, as in `a += 2` (same as `a = a + 2`).
* Increment/Decrement: `++` (increment), `--` (decrement), as in `a++` (similar to `a = a + 1`).
* Object Property Access: `.` as in `console.log()`.
   Objects are values that hold other values at specific named locations called properties. `obj.a` means an object value called `obj` with a property of the name `a`. Properties can alternatively be accessed as `obj["a"]`. See Chapter 2.
* Equality: `==` (loose-equals), `===` (strict-equals), `!=` (loose not-equals), `!==` (strict not-equals), as in `a == b`.
   See "Values & Types" and Chapter 2.
* Comparison: `<` (less than), `>` (greater than), `<=` (less than or loose-equals), `>=` (greater than or loose-equals), as in `a <= b`.
   See "Values & Types" and Chapter 2.
* Logical: `&&` (and), `||` (or), as in `a || b` that selects either `a` *or* `b`.
   These operators are used to express compound conditionals (see "Conditionals"), like if either `a` *or* `b` is true.
Note: For much more detail, and coverage of operators not mentioned here, see the Mozilla Developer Network (MDN)'s "Expressions and Operators" (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators).

Values & Types~
If you ask an employee at a phone store how much a certain phone costs, and they say "ninety-nine, ninety-nine" (i.e., $99.99), they're giving you an actual numeric dollar figure that represents what you'll need to pay (plus taxes) to buy it. If you want to buy two of those phones, you can easily do the mental math to double that value to get $199.98 for your base cost.
If that same employee picks up another similar phone but says it's "free" (perhaps with air quotes), they're not giving you a number, but instead another kind of representation of your expected cost ($0.00) -- the word "free."
When you later ask if the phone includes a charger, that answer could only have been either "yes" or "no."
In very similar ways, when you express values in a program, you choose different representations for those values based on what you plan to do with them.
These different representations for values are called *types* in programming terminology. JavaScript has built-in types for each of these so called *primitive* values:
* When you need to do math, you want a `number`.
* When you need to print a value on the screen, you need a `string` (one or more characters, words, sentences).
* When you need to make a decision in your program, you need a `boolean` (`true` or `false`).
Values that are included directly in the source code are called *literals*. `string` literals are surrounded by double quotes `"..."` or single quotes (`'...'`) -- the only difference is stylistic preference. `number` and `boolean` literals are just presented as is (i.e., `42`, `true`, etc.).
Consider:
>
  "I am a string";
  'I am also a string';
  42;
  true;
  false;

Beyond `string`/`number`/`boolean` value types, it's common for programming languages to provide *arrays*, *objects*, *functions*, and more. We'll cover much more about values and types throughout this chapter and the next.

Converting Between Types~
If you have a `number` but need to print it on the screen, you need to convert the value to a `string`, and in JavaScript this conversion is called "coercion." Similarly, if someone enters a series of numeric characters into a form on an ecommerce page, that's a `string`, but if you need to then use that value to do math operations, you need to *coerce* it to a `number`.
JavaScript provides several different facilities for forcibly coercing between *types*. For example:
>
  var a = "42";
  var b = Number( a );
  console.log( a );	// "42"
  console.log( b );	// 42

Using `Number(..)` (a built-in function) as shown is an *explicit* coercion from any other type to the `number` type. That should be pretty straightforward.
But a controversial topic is what happens when you try to compare two values that are not already of the same type, which would require *implicit* coercion.
When comparing the string `"99.99"` to the number `99.99`, most people would agree they are equivalent. But they're not exactly the same, are they? It's the same value in two different representations, two different *types*. You could say they're "loosely equal," couldn't you?
To help you out in these common situations, JavaScript will sometimes kick in and *implicitly* coerce values to the matching types.
So if you use the `==` loose equals operator to make the comparison `"99.99" == 99.99`, JavaScript will convert the left-hand side `"99.99"` to its `number` equivalent `99.99`. The comparison then becomes `99.99 == 99.99`, which is of course `true`.
While designed to help you, implicit coercion can create confusion if you haven't taken the time to learn the rules that govern its behavior. Most JS developers never have, so the common feeling is that implicit coercion is confusing and harms programs with unexpected bugs, and should thus be avoided. It's even sometimes called a flaw in the design of the language.
However, implicit coercion is a mechanism that *can be learned*, and moreover *should be learned* by anyone wishing to take JavaScript programming seriously. Not only is it not confusing once you learn the rules, it can actually make your programs better! The effort is well worth it.
Note: For more information on coercion, see Chapter 2 of this title and Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

Code Comments~
The phone store employee might jot down some notes on the features of a newly released phone or on the new plans her company offers. These notes are only for the employee -- they're not for customers to read. Nevertheless, these notes help the employee do her job better by documenting the hows and whys of what she should tell customers.
One of the most important lessons you can learn about writing code is that it's not just for the computer. Code is every bit as much, if not more, for the developer as it is for the compiler.
Your computer only cares about machine code, a series of binary 0s and 1s, that comes from *compilation*. There's a nearly infinite number of programs you could write that yield the same series of 0s and 1s. The choices you make about how to write your program matter -- not only to you, but to your other team members and even to your future self.
You should strive not just to write programs that work correctly, but programs that make sense when examined. You can go a long way in that effort by choosing good names for your variables (see "Variables") and functions (see "Functions").
But another important part is code comments. These are bits of text in your program that are inserted purely to explain things to a human. The interpreter/compiler will always ignore these comments.
There are lots of opinions on what makes well-commented code; we can't really define absolute universal rules. But some observations and guidelines are quite useful:
* Code without comments is suboptimal.
* Too many comments (one per line, for example) is probably a sign of poorly written code.
* Comments should explain *why*, not *what*. They can optionally explain *how* if that's particularly confusing.
In JavaScript, there are two types of comments possible: a single-line comment and a multiline comment.
Consider:
>
  // This is a single-line comment
  /* But this is
         a multiline
               comment.
                        */

  The `//` single-line comment is appropriate if you're going to put a comment right above a single statement, or even at the end of a line. Everything on the line after the `//` is treated as the comment (and thus ignored by the compiler), all the way to the end of the line. There's no restriction to what can appear inside a single-line comment.
  Consider:
  >
  var a = 42;		// 42 is the meaning of life

The `/* .. */` multiline comment is appropriate if you have several lines worth of explanation to make in your comment.
Here's a common usage of multiline comments:
>
/* The following value is used because
   it has been shown that it answers
   every question in the universe. */
var a = 42;

It can also appear anywhere on a line, even in the middle of a line, because the `*/` ends it. For example:
>
  var a = /* arbitrary value */ 42;
  console.log( a );	// 42

The only thing that cannot appear inside a multiline comment is a `*/`, because that would be interpreted to end the comment.
You will definitely want to begin your learning of programming by starting off with the habit of commenting code. Throughout the rest of this chapter, you'll see I use comments to explain things, so do the same in your own practice. Trust me, everyone who reads your code will thank you!

Variables~
Most useful programs need to track a value as it changes over the course of the program, undergoing different operations as called for by your program's intended tasks.
The easiest way to go about that in your program is to assign a value to a symbolic container, called a *variable* -- so called because the value in this container can *vary* over time as needed.
In some programming languages, you declare a variable (container) to hold a specific type of value, such as `number` or `string`. *Static typing*, otherwise known as *type enforcement*, is typically cited as a benefit for program correctness by preventing unintended value conversions.
Other languages emphasize types for values instead of variables. *Weak typing*, otherwise known as *dynamic typing*, allows a variable to hold any type of value at any time. It's typically cited as a benefit for program flexibility by allowing a single variable to represent a value no matter what type form that value may take at any given moment in the program's logic flow.
JavaScript uses the latter approach, *dynamic typing*, meaning variables can hold values of any *type* without any *type* enforcement.
As mentioned earlier, we declare a variable using the `var` statement -- notice there's no other *type* information in the declaration. Consider this simple program:
>
  var amount = 99.99;
  amount = amount * 2;
  console.log( amount );		// 199.98
  // convert `amount` to a string, and
  // add "$" on the beginning
  amount = "$" + String( amount );
  console.log( amount );		// "$199.98"

The `amount` variable starts out holding the number `99.99`, and then holds the `number` result of `amount * 2`, which is `199.98`.
The first `console.log(..)` command has to *implicitly* coerce that `number` value to a `string` to print it out.
Then the statement `amount = "$" + String(amount)` *explicitly* coerces the `199.98` value to a `string` and adds a `"$"` character to the beginning. At this point, `amount` now holds the `string` value `"$199.98"`, so the second `console.log(..)` statement doesn't need to do any coercion to print it out.
JavaScript developers will note the flexibility of using the `amount` variable for each of the `99.99`, `199.98`, and the `"$199.98"` values. Static-typing enthusiasts would prefer a separate variable like `amountStr` to hold the final `"$199.98"` representation of the value, because it's a different type.
Either way, you'll note that `amount` holds a running value that changes over the course of the program, illustrating the primary purpose of variables: managing program *state*.
In other words, *state* is tracking the changes to values as your program runs.
Another common usage of variables is for centralizing value setting. This is more typically called *constants*, when you declare a variable with a value and intend for that value to *not change* throughout the program.
You declare these *constants*, often at the top of a program, so that it's convenient for you to have one place to go to alter a value if you need to. By convention, JavaScript variables as constants are usually capitalized, with underscores `_` between multiple words.
Here's a silly example:
>
  var TAX_RATE = 0.08;	// 8% sales tax
  var amount = 99.99;
  amount = amount * 2;
  amount = amount + (amount * TAX_RATE);
  console.log( amount );				// 215.9784
  console.log( amount.toFixed( 2 ) );	// "215.98"

Note: Similar to how `console.log(..)` is a function `log(..)` accessed as an object property on the `console` value, `toFixed(..)` here is a function that can be accessed on `number` values. JavaScript `number`s aren't automatically formatted for dollars -- the engine doesn't know what your intent is and there's no type for currency. `toFixed(..)` lets us specify how many decimal places we'd like the `number` rounded to, and it produces the `string` as necessary.
The `TAX_RATE` variable is only *constant* by convention -- there's nothing special in this program that prevents it from being changed. But if the city raises the sales tax rate to 9%, we can still easily update our program by setting the `TAX_RATE` assigned value to `0.09` in one place, instead of finding many occurrences of the value `0.08` strewn throughout the program and updating all of them.
The newest version of JavaScript at the time of this writing (commonly called "ES6") includes a new way to declare *constants*, by using `const` instead of `var`:
>
  // as of ES6:
  const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
  var amount = 99.99;
  // ..

Constants are useful just like variables with unchanged values, except that constants also prevent accidentally changing value somewhere else after the initial setting. If you tried to assign any different value to `TAX_RATE` after that first declaration, your program would reject the change (and in strict mode, fail with an error -- see "Strict Mode" in Chapter 2).
By the way, that kind of "protection" against mistakes is similar to the static-typing type enforcement, so you can see why static types in other languages can be attractive!
Note: For more information about how different values in variables can be used in your programs, see the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.
Blocks~
The phone store employee must go through a series of steps to complete the checkout as you buy your new phone.
Similarly, in code we often need to group a series of statements together, which we often call a *block*. In JavaScript, a block is defined by wrapping one or more statements inside a curly-brace pair `{ .. }`. Consider:
>
  var amount = 99.99;
  // a general block
  {
          amount = amount * 2;
          console.log( amount );	// 199.98
  }

This kind of standalone `{ .. }` general block is valid, but isn't as commonly seen in JS programs. Typically, blocks are attached to some other control statement, such as an `if` statement (see "Conditionals") or a loop (see "Loops"). For example:
>
  var amount = 99.99;
  // is amount big enough?
  if (amount > 10) {			// <-- block attached to `if`
          amount = amount * 2;
          console.log( amount );	// 199.98
  }

We'll explain `if` statements in the next section, but as you can see, the `{ .. }` block with its two statements is attached to `if (amount > 10)`; the statements inside the block will only be processed if the conditional passes.
Note: Unlike most other statements like `console.log(amount);`, a block statement does not need a semicolon (`;`) to conclude it.
Conditionals~
"Do you want to add on the extra screen protectors to your purchase, for $9.99?" The helpful phone store employee has asked you to make a decision. And you may need to first consult the current *state* of your wallet or bank account to answer that question. But obviously, this is just a simple "yes or no" question.
There are quite a few ways we can express *conditionals* (aka decisions) in our programs.
The most common one is the `if` statement. Essentially, you're saying, "*If* this condition is true, do the following...". For example:
>
  var bank_balance = 302.13;
  var amount = 99.99;
  if (amount < bank_balance) {
          console.log( "I want to buy this phone!" );
  }

The `if` statement requires an expression in between the parentheses `( )` that can be treated as either `true` or `false`. In this program, we provided the expression `amount < bank_balance`, which indeed will either evaluate to `true` or `false` depending on the amount in the `bank_balance` variable.
You can even provide an alternative if the condition isn't true, called an `else` clause. Consider:
>
  const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;
  var bank_balance = 302.13;
  var amount = 99.99;
  amount = amount * 2;
  // can we afford the extra purchase?
  if ( amount < bank_balance ) {
          console.log( "I'll take the accessory!" );
          amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
  }
  // otherwise:
  else {
          console.log( "No, thanks." );
  }

Here, if `amount < bank_balance` is `true`, we'll print out `"I'll take the accessory!"` and add the `9.99` to our `amount` variable. Otherwise, the `else` clause says we'll just politely respond with `"No, thanks."` and leave `amount` unchanged.
As we discussed in "Values & Types" earlier, values that aren't already of an expected type are often coerced to that type. The `if` statement expects a `boolean`, but if you pass it something that's not already `boolean`, coercion will occur.
JavaScript defines a list of specific values that are considered "falsy" because when coerced to a `boolean`, they become `false` -- these include values like `0` and `""`. Any other value not on the "falsy" list is automatically "truthy" -- when coerced to a `boolean` they become `true`. Truthy values include things like `99.99` and `"free"`. See "Truthy & Falsy" in Chapter 2 for more information.
*Conditionals* exist in other forms besides the `if`. For example, the `switch` statement can be used as a shorthand for a series of `if..else` statements (see Chapter 2). Loops (see "Loops") use a *conditional* to determine if the loop should keep going or stop.
Note: For deeper information about the coercions that can occur implicitly in the test expressions of *conditionals*, see Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.
Loops~
During busy times, there's a waiting list for customers who need to speak to the phone store employee. While there's still people on that list, she just needs to keep serving the next customer.
Repeating a set of actions until a certain condition fails -- in other words, repeating only while the condition holds -- is the job of programming loops; loops can take different forms, but they all satisfy this basic behavior.
A loop includes the test condition as well as a block (typically as `{ .. }`). Each time the loop block executes, that's called an *iteration*.
For example, the `while` loop and the `do..while` loop forms illustrate the concept of repeating a block of statements until a condition no longer evaluates to `true`:
>
  while (numOfCustomers > 0) {
          console.log( "How may I help you?" );
          // help the customer...
          numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;
  }
  // versus:
  do {
          console.log( "How may I help you?" );
          // help the customer...
          numOfCustomers = numOfCustomers - 1;
  } while (numOfCustomers > 0);

The only practical difference between these loops is whether the conditional is tested before the first iteration (`while`) or after the first iteration (`do..while`).
In either form, if the conditional tests as `false`, the next iteration will not run. That means if the condition is initially `false`, a `while` loop will never run, but a `do..while` loop will run just the first time.
Sometimes you are looping for the intended purpose of counting a certain set of numbers, like from `0` to `9` (ten numbers). You can do that by setting a loop iteration variable like `i` at value `0` and incrementing it by `1` each iteration.
Warning: For a variety of historical reasons, programming languages almost always count things in a zero-based fashion, meaning starting with `0` instead of `1`. If you're not familiar with that mode of thinking, it can be quite confusing at first. Take some time to practice counting starting with `0` to become more comfortable with it!
The conditional is tested on each iteration, much as if there is an implied `if` statement inside the loop.
We can use JavaScript's `break` statement to stop a loop. Also, we can observe that it's awfully easy to create a loop that would otherwise run forever without a `break`ing mechanism.
Let's illustrate:
>
  var i = 0;
  // a `while..true` loop would run forever, right?
  while (true) {
          // stop the loop?
          if ((i <= 9) === false) {
                  break;
          }
          console.log( i );
          i = i + 1;
  }
  // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

Warning: This is not necessarily a practical form you'd want to use for your loops. It's presented here for illustration purposes only.
While a `while` (or `do..while`) can accomplish the task manually, there's another syntactic form called a `for` loop for just that purpose:
>
  for (var i = 0; i <= 9; i = i + 1) {
          console.log( i );
  }
  // 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

As you can see, in both cases the conditional `i <= 9` is `true` for the first 10 iterations (`i` of values `0` through `9`) of either loop form, but becomes `false` once `i` is value `10`.
The `for` loop has three clauses: the initialization clause (`var i=0`), the conditional test clause (`i <= 9`), and the update clause (`i = i + 1`). So if you're going to do counting with your loop iterations, `for` is a more compact and often easier form to understand and write.
There are other specialized loop forms that are intended to iterate over specific values, such as the properties of an object (see Chapter 2) where the implied conditional test is just whether all the properties have been processed. The "loop until a condition fails" concept holds no matter what the form of the loop.
Functions~
The phone store employee probably doesn't carry around a calculator to figure out the taxes and final purchase amount. That's a task she needs to define once and reuse over and over again. Odds are, the company has a checkout register (computer, tablet, etc.) with those "functions" built in.
Similarly, your program will almost certainly want to break up the code's tasks into reusable pieces, instead of repeatedly repeating yourself repetitiously (pun intended!). The way to do this is to define a `function`.
A function is generally a named section of code that can be "called" by name, and the code inside it will be run each time. Consider:
>
  function printAmount() {
          console.log( amount.toFixed( 2 ) );
  }
  var amount = 99.99;
  printAmount(); // "99.99"
  amount = amount * 2;
  printAmount(); // "199.98"

  Functions can optionally take arguments (aka parameters) -- values you pass in. And they can also optionally return a value back.
  >
  function printAmount(amt) {
          console.log( amt.toFixed( 2 ) );
  }
  function formatAmount() {
          return "$" + amount.toFixed( 2 );
  }
  var amount = 99.99;
  printAmount( amount * 2 );		// "199.98"
  amount = formatAmount();
  console.log( amount );			// "$99.99"

The function `printAmount(..)` takes a parameter that we call `amt`. The function `formatAmount()` returns a value. Of course, you can also combine those two techniques in the same function.
Functions are often used for code that you plan to call multiple times, but they can also be useful just to organize related bits of code into named collections, even if you only plan to call them once.
Consider:
>
  const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
  function calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(amt) {
          // calculate the new amount with the tax
          amt = amt + (amt * TAX_RATE);
          // return the new amount
          return amt;
  }
  var amount = 99.99;
  amount = calculateFinalPurchaseAmount( amount );
  console.log( amount.toFixed( 2 ) );		// "107.99"

Although `calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(..)` is only called once, organizing its behavior into a separate named function makes the code that uses its logic (the `amount = calculateFinal...` statement) cleaner. If the function had more statements in it, the benefits would be even more pronounced.

Scope~
If you ask the phone store employee for a phone model that her store doesn't carry, she will not be able to sell you the phone you want. She only has access to the phones in her store's inventory. You'll have to try another store to see if you can find the phone you're looking for.
Programming has a term for this concept: *scope* (technically called *lexical scope*). In JavaScript, each function gets its own scope. Scope is basically a collection of variables as well as the rules for how those variables are accessed by name. Only code inside that function can access that function's *scoped* variables.
A variable name has to be unique within the same scope -- there can't be two different `a` variables sitting right next to each other. But the same variable name `a` could appear in different scopes.
>
  function one() {
          // this `a` only belongs to the `one()` function
          var a = 1;
          console.log( a );
  }
  function two() {
          // this `a` only belongs to the `two()` function
          var a = 2;
          console.log( a );
  }
  one();		// 1
  two();		// 2

Also, a scope can be nested inside another scope, just like if a clown at a birthday party blows up one balloon inside another balloon. If one scope is nested inside another, code inside the innermost scope can access variables from either scope.
Consider:
>
  function outer() {
          var a = 1;
          function inner() {
                  var b = 2;
                  // we can access both `a` and `b` here
                  console.log( a + b );	// 3
          }
          inner();
          // we can only access `a` here
          console.log( a );			// 1
  }
  outer();

Lexical scope rules say that code in one scope can access variables of either that scope or any scope outside of it.
So, code inside the `inner()` function has access to both variables `a` and `b`, but code in `outer()` has access only to `a` -- it cannot access `b` because that variable is only inside `inner()`.
Recall this code snippet from earlier:
>
  const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
  function calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(amt) {
          // calculate the new amount with the tax
          amt = amt + (amt * TAX_RATE);
          // return the new amount
          return amt;
  }

The `TAX_RATE` constant (variable) is accessible from inside the `calculateFinalPurchaseAmount(..)` function, even though we didn't pass it in, because of lexical scope.
Note: For more information about lexical scope, see the first three chapters of the *Scope & Closures* title of this series.

Practice~
There is absolutely no substitute for practice in learning programming. No amount of articulate writing on my part is alone going to make you a programmer.
With that in mind, let's try practicing some of the concepts we learned here in this chapter. I'll give the "requirements," and you try it first. Then consult the code listing below to see how I approached it.
* Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of money in your bank account. You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your mental spending threshold.
* After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted.
* Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
* You should set up some constants for the "tax rate," "phone price," "accessory price," and "spending threshold," as well as a variable for your "bank account balance.""
* You should define functions for calculating the tax and for formatting the price with a "$" and rounding to two decimal places.
* Bonus Challenge: Try to incorporate input into this program, perhaps with the `prompt(..)` covered in "Input" earlier. You may prompt the user for their bank account balance, for example. Have fun and be creative!
OK, go ahead. Try it. Don't peek at my code listing until you've given it a shot yourself!
Note: Because this is a JavaScript book, I'm obviously going to solve the practice exercise in JavaScript. But you can do it in another language for now if you feel more comfortable.
Here's my JavaScript solution for this exercise:
>
  const SPENDING_THRESHOLD = 200;
  const TAX_RATE = 0.08;
  const PHONE_PRICE = 99.99;
  const ACCESSORY_PRICE = 9.99;
  var bank_balance = 303.91;
  var amount = 0;
  function calculateTax(amount) {
          return amount * TAX_RATE;
  }
  function formatAmount(amount) {
          return "$" + amount.toFixed( 2 );
  }
  // keep buying phones while you still have money
  while (amount < bank_balance) {
          // buy a new phone!
          amount = amount + PHONE_PRICE;
          // can we afford the accessory?
          if (amount < SPENDING_THRESHOLD) {
                  amount = amount + ACCESSORY_PRICE;
          }
  }
  // don't forget to pay the government, too
  amount = amount + calculateTax( amount );
  console.log(
          "Your purchase: " + formatAmount( amount )
  );
  // Your purchase: $334.76
  // can you actually afford this purchase?
  if (amount > bank_balance) {
          console.log(
                  "You can't afford this purchase. :("
          );
  }
  // You can't afford this purchase. :(

Note:The simplest way to run this JavaScript program is to type it into the developer console of your nearest browser.
How did you do? It wouldn't hurt to try it again now that you've seen my code. And play around with changing some of the constants to see how the program runs with different values.

Review~
Learning programming doesn't have to be a complex and overwhelming process. There are just a few basic concepts you need to wrap your head around.
These act like building blocks. To build a tall tower, you start first by putting block on top of block on top of block. The same goes with programming. Here are some of the essential programming building blocks:
* You need *operators* to perform actions on values.
* You need values and *types* to perform different kinds of actions like math on `number`s or output with `string`s.
* You need *variables* to store data (aka *state*) during your program's execution.
* You need *conditionals* like `if` statements to make decisions.
* You need *loops* to repeat tasks until a condition stops being true.
* You need *functions* to organize your code into logical and reusable chunks.
Code comments are one effective way to write more readable code, which makes your program easier to understand, maintain, and fix later if there are problems.
Finally, don't neglect the power of practice. The best way to learn how to write code is to write code.
I'm excited you're well on your way to learning how to code, now! Keep it up. Don't forget to check out other beginner programming resources (books, blogs, online training, etc.). This chapter and this book are a great start, but they're just a brief introduction.
The next chapter will review many of the concepts from this chapter, but from a more JavaScript-specific perspective, which will highlight most of the major topics that are addressed in deeper detail throughout the rest of the series.


Chapter 2: Into JavaScript~ *IntoJavaScript*

In the previous chapter, I introduced the basic building blocks of programming, such as variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Of course, all the code shown has been in JavaScript. But in this chapter, we want to focus specifically on things you need to know about JavaScript to get up and going as a JS developer.
We will introduce quite a few concepts in this chapter that will not be fully explored until subsequent *YDKJS* books. You can think of this chapter as an overview of the topics covered in detail throughout the rest of this series.
Especially if you're new to JavaScript, you should expect to spend quite a bit of time reviewing the concepts and code examples here multiple times. Any good foundation is laid brick by brick, so don't expect that you'll immediately understand it all the first pass through.
Your journey to deeply learn JavaScript starts here.
Note: As I said in Chapter 1, you should definitely try all this code yourself as you read and work through this chapter. Be aware that some of the code here assumes capabilities introduced in the newest version of JavaScript at the time of this writing (commonly referred to as "ES6" for the 6th edition of ECMAScript -- the official name of the JS specification). If you happen to be using an older, pre-ES6 browser, the code may not work. A recent update of a modern browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or IE) should be used.

Values & Types~
As we asserted in Chapter 1, JavaScript has typed values, not typed variables. The following built-in types are available:
* `string`
* `number`
* `boolean`
* `null` and `undefined`
* `object`
* `symbol` (new to ES6)
JavaScript provides a `typeof` operator that can examine a value and tell you what type it is:
>
  var a;
  typeof a;				// "undefined"
  a = "hello world";
  typeof a;				// "string"
  a = 42;
  typeof a;				// "number"
  a = true;
  typeof a;				// "boolean"
  a = null;
  typeof a;				// "object" -- weird, bug
  a = undefined;
  typeof a;				// "undefined"
  a = { b: "c" };
  typeof a;				// "object"

The return value from the `typeof` operator is always one of six (seven as of ES6! - the "symbol" type) string values. That is, `typeof "abc"` returns `"string"`, not `string`.
Notice how in this snippet the `a` variable holds every different type of value, and that despite appearances, `typeof a` is not asking for the "type of `a`", but rather for the "type of the value currently in `a`." Only values have types in JavaScript; variables are just simple containers for those values.
`typeof null` is an interesting case, because it errantly returns `"object"`, when you'd expect it to return `"null"`.
Warning: This is a long-standing bug in JS, but one that is likely never going to be fixed. Too much code on the Web relies on the bug and thus fixing it would cause a lot more bugs!
Also, note `a = undefined`. We're explicitly setting `a` to the `undefined` value, but that is behaviorally no different from a variable that has no value set yet, like with the `var a;` line at the top of the snippet. A variable can get to this "undefined" value state in several different ways, including functions that return no values and usage of the `void` operator.

Objects~
The `object` type refers to a compound value where you can set properties (named locations) that each hold their own values of any type. This is perhaps one of the most useful value types in all of JavaScript.
>
  var obj = {
          a: "hello world",
          b: 42,
          c: true
  };
  obj.a;		// "hello world"
  obj.b;		// 42
  obj.c;		// true
  obj["a"];	// "hello world"
  obj["b"];	// 42
  obj["c"];	// true

It may be helpful to think of this `obj` value visually:
<img src="fig4.png">
Properties can either be accessed with *dot notation* (i.e., `obj.a`) or *bracket notation* (i.e., `obj["a"]`). Dot notation is shorter and generally easier to read, and is thus preferred when possible.
Bracket notation is useful if you have a property name that has special characters in it, like `obj["hello world!"]` -- such properties are often referred to as *keys* when accessed via bracket notation. The `[ ]` notation requires either a variable (explained next) or a `string` *literal* (which needs to be wrapped in `" .. "` or `' .. '`).
Of course, bracket notation is also useful if you want to access a property/key but the name is stored in another variable, such as:
>
  var obj = {
          a: "hello world",
          b: 42
  };
  var b = "a";
  obj[b];			// "hello world"
  obj["b"];		// 42

Note: For more information on JavaScript `object`s, see the *this & Object Prototypes* title of this series, specifically Chapter 3.
There are a couple of other value types that you will commonly interact with in JavaScript programs: *array* and *function*. But rather than being proper built-in types, these should be thought of more like subtypes -- specialized versions of the `object` type.

Arrays~
An array is an `object` that holds values (of any type) not particularly in named properties/keys, but rather in numerically indexed positions. For example:
>
  var arr = [
          "hello world",
          42,
          true
  ];
  arr[0];			// "hello world"
  arr[1];			// 42
  arr[2];			// true
  arr.length;		// 3
  typeof arr;		// "object"

Note: Languages that start counting at zero, like JS does, use `0` as the index of the first element in the array.
It may be helpful to think of `arr` visually:
<img src="fig5.png">
Because arrays are special objects (as `typeof` implies), they can also have properties, including the automatically updated `length` property.
You theoretically could use an array as a normal object with your own named properties, or you could use an `object` but only give it numeric properties (`0`, `1`, etc.) similar to an array. However, this would generally be considered improper usage of the respective types.
The best and most natural approach is to use arrays for numerically positioned values and use `object`s for named properties.

Functions~
The other `object` subtype you'll use all over your JS programs is a function:
>
  function foo() {
          return 42;
  }
  foo.bar = "hello world";
  typeof foo;			// "function"
  typeof foo();		// "number"
  typeof foo.bar;		// "string"

Again, functions are a subtype of `objects` -- `typeof` returns `"function"`, which implies that a `function` is a main type -- and can thus have properties, but you typically will only use function object properties (like `foo.bar`) in limited cases.
Note: For more information on JS values and their types, see the first two chapters of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

Built-In Type Methods~
The built-in types and subtypes we've just discussed have behaviors exposed as properties and methods that are quite powerful and useful.
For example:
>
  var a = "hello world";
  var b = 3.14159;
  a.length;				// 11
  a.toUpperCase();		// "HELLO WORLD"
  b.toFixed(4);			// "3.1416"

The "how" behind being able to call `a.toUpperCase()` is more complicated than just that method existing on the value.
Briefly, there is a `String` (capital `S`) object wrapper form, typically called a "native," that pairs with the primitive `string` type; it's this object wrapper that defines the `toUpperCase()` method on its prototype.
When you use a primitive value like `"hello world"` as an `object` by referencing a property or method (e.g., `a.toUpperCase()` in the previous snippet), JS automatically "boxes" the value to its object wrapper counterpart (hidden under the covers).
A `string` value can be wrapped by a `String` object, a `number` can be wrapped by a `Number` object, and a `boolean` can be wrapped by a `Boolean` object. For the most part, you don't need to worry about or directly use these object wrapper forms of the values -- prefer the primitive value forms in practically all cases and JavaScript will take care of the rest for you.
Note: For more information on JS natives and "boxing," see Chapter 3 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series. To better understand the prototype of an object, see Chapter 5 of the *this & Object Prototypes* title of this series.

Comparing Values~
There are two main types of value comparison that you will need to make in your JS programs: *equality* and *inequality*. The result of any comparison is a strictly `boolean` value (`true` or `false`), regardless of what value types are compared.

Coercion~
We talked briefly about coercion in Chapter 1, but let's revisit it here.
Coercion comes in two forms in JavaScript: *explicit* and *implicit*. Explicit coercion is simply that you can see obviously from the code that a conversion from one type to another will occur, whereas implicit coercion is when the type conversion can happen as more of a non-obvious side effect of some other operation.
You've probably heard sentiments like "coercion is evil" drawn from the fact that there are clearly places where coercion can produce some surprising results. Perhaps nothing evokes frustration from developers more than when the language surprises them.
Coercion is not evil, nor does it have to be surprising. In fact, the majority of cases you can construct with type coercion are quite sensible and understandable, and can even be used to *improve* the readability of your code. But we won't go much further into that debate -- Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series covers all sides.
Here's an example of *explicit* coercion:
>
  var a = "42";
  var b = Number( a );
  a;				// "42"
  b;				// 42 -- the number!

And here's an example of *implicit* coercion:
>
  var a = "42";
  var b = a * 1;	// "42" implicitly coerced to 42 here
  a;				// "42"
  b;				// 42 -- the number!


Truthy & Falsy~
In Chapter 1, we briefly mentioned the "truthy" and "falsy" nature of values: when a non-`boolean` value is coerced to a `boolean`, does it become `true` or `false`, respectively?
The specific list of "falsy" values in JavaScript is as follows:
* `""` (empty string)
* `0`, `-0`, `NaN` (invalid `number`)
* `null`, `undefined`
* `false`
Any value that's not on this "falsy" list is "truthy." Here are some examples of those:
* `"hello"`
* `42`
* `true`
* `[ ]`, `[ 1, "2", 3 ]` (arrays)
* `{ }`, `{ a: 42 }` (objects)
* `function foo() { .. }` (functions)
It's important to remember that a non-`boolean` value only follows this "truthy"/"falsy" coercion if it's actually coerced to a `boolean`. It's not all that difficult to confuse yourself with a situation that seems like it's coercing a value to a `boolean` when it's not.

Equality~
There are four equality operators: `==`, `===`, `!=`, and `!==`. The `!` forms are of course the symmetric "not equal" versions of their counterparts; *non-equality* should not be confused with *inequality*.
The difference between `==` and `===` is usually characterized that `==` checks for value equality and `===` checks for both value and type equality. However, this is inaccurate. The proper way to characterize them is that `==` checks for value equality with coercion allowed, and `===` checks for value equality without allowing coercion; `===` is often called "strict equality" for this reason.
Consider the implicit coercion that's allowed by the `==` loose-equality comparison and not allowed with the `===` strict-equality:
>
  var a = "42";
  var b = 42;
  a == b;			// true
  a === b;		// false

In the `a == b` comparison, JS notices that the types do not match, so it goes through an ordered series of steps to coerce one or both values to a different type until the types match, where then a simple value equality can be checked.
If you think about it, there's two possible ways `a == b` could give `true` via coercion. Either the comparison could end up as `42 == 42` or it could be `"42" == "42"`. So which is it?
The answer: `"42"` becomes `42`, to make the comparison `42 == 42`. In such a simple example, it doesn't really seem to matter which way that process goes, as the end result is the same. There are more complex cases where it matters not just what the end result of the comparison is, but *how* you get there.
The `a === b` produces `false`, because the coercion is not allowed, so the simple value comparison obviously fails. Many developers feel that `===` is more predictable, so they advocate always using that form and staying away from `==`. I think this view is very shortsighted. I believe `==` is a powerful tool that helps your program, *if you take the time to learn how it works.*
We're not going to cover all the nitty-gritty details of how the coercion in `==` comparisons works here. Much of it is pretty sensible, but there are some important corner cases to be careful of. You can read section 11.9.3 of the ES5 specification (http://www.ecma-international.org/ecma-262/5.1/) to see the exact rules, and you'll be surprised at just how straightforward this mechanism is, compared to all the negative hype surrounding it.
To boil down a whole lot of details to a few simple takeaways, and help you know whether to use `==` or `===` in various situations, here are my simple rules:
* If either value (aka side) in a comparison could be the `true` or `false` value, avoid `==` and use `===`.
* If either value in a comparison could be one of these specific values (`0`, `""`, or `[]` -- empty array), avoid `==` and use `===`.
* In *all* other cases, you're safe to use `==`. Not only is it safe, but in many cases it simplifies your code in a way that improves readability.
What these rules boil down to is requiring you to think critically about your code and about what kinds of values can come through variables that get compared for equality. If you can be certain about the values, and `==` is safe, use it! If you can't be certain about the values, use `===`. It's that simple.
The `!=` non-equality form pairs with `==`, and the `!==` form pairs with `===`. All the rules and observations we just discussed hold symmetrically for these non-equality comparisons.
You should take special note of the `==` and `===` comparison rules if you're comparing two non-primitive values, like `object`s (including `function` and `array`). Because those values are actually held by reference, both `==` and `===` comparisons will simply check whether the references match, not anything about the underlying values.
For example, `array`s are by default coerced to `string`s by simply joining all the values with commas (`,`) in between. You might think that two `array`s with the same contents would be `==` equal, but they're not:
>
  var a = [1,2,3];
  var b = [1,2,3];
  var c = "1,2,3";
  a == c;		// true
  b == c;		// true
  a == b;		// false

Note: For more information about the `==` equality comparison rules, see the ES5 specification (section 11.9.3) and also consult Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series; see Chapter 2 for more information about values versus references.

Inequality~
The `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=` operators are used for inequality, referred to in the specification as "relational comparison." Typically they will be used with ordinally comparable values like `number`s. It's easy to understand that `3 < 4`.
But JavaScript `string` values can also be compared for inequality, using typical alphabetic rules (`"bar" < "foo"`).
What about coercion? Similar rules as `==` comparison (though not exactly identical!) apply to the inequality operators. Notably, there are no "strict inequality" operators that would disallow coercion the same way `===` "strict equality" does.
Consider:
>
  var a = 41;
  var b = "42";
  var c = "43";
  a < b;		// true
  b < c;		// true

What happens here? In section 11.8.5 of the ES5 specification, it says that if both values in the `<` comparison are `string`s, as it is with `b < c`, the comparison is made lexicographically (aka alphabetically like a dictionary). But if one or both is not a `string`, as it is with `a < b`, then both values are coerced to be `number`s, and a typical numeric comparison occurs.
The biggest gotcha you may run into here with comparisons between potentially different value types -- remember, there are no "strict inequality" forms to use -- is when one of the values cannot be made into a valid number, such as:
>
  var a = 42;
  var b = "foo";
  a < b;		// false
  a > b;		// false
  a == b;		// false

Wait, how can all three of those comparisons be `false`? Because the `b` value is being coerced to the "invalid number value" `NaN` in the `<` and `>` comparisons, and the specification says that `NaN` is neither greater-than nor less-than any other value.
The `==` comparison fails for a different reason. `a == b` could fail if it's interpreted either as `42 == NaN` or `"42" == "foo"` -- as we explained earlier, the former is the case.
Note: For more information about the inequality comparison rules, see section 11.8.5 of the ES5 specification and also consult Chapter 4 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

Variables~
In JavaScript, variable names (including function names) must be valid *identifiers*. The strict and complete rules for valid characters in identifiers are a little complex when you consider nontraditional characters such as Unicode. If you only consider typical ASCII alphanumeric characters though, the rules are simple.
An identifier must start with `a`-`z`, `A`-`Z`, `$`, or `_`. It can then contain any of those characters plus the numerals `0`-`9`.
Generally, the same rules apply to a property name as to a variable identifier. However, certain words cannot be used as variables, but are OK as property names. These words are called "reserved words," and include the JS keywords (`for`, `in`, `if`, etc.) as well as `null`, `true`, and `false`.
Note: For more information about reserved words, see Appendix A of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

Function Scopes~
You use the `var` keyword to declare a variable that will belong to the current function scope, or the global scope if at the top level outside of any function.

Hoisting~
Wherever a `var` appears inside a scope, that declaration is taken to belong to the entire scope and accessible everywhere throughout.
Metaphorically, this behavior is called *hoisting*, when a `var` declaration is conceptually "moved" to the top of its enclosing scope. Technically, this process is more accurately explained by how code is compiled, but we can skip over those details for now.
Consider:
>
  var a = 2;
  foo();					// works because `foo()`
                                                  // declaration is "hoisted"
  function foo() {
          a = 3;
          console.log( a );	// 3
          var a;				// declaration is "hoisted"
                                                  // to the top of `foo()`
  }
  console.log( a );	// 2

Warning: It's not common or a good idea to rely on variable *hoisting* to use a variable earlier in its scope than its `var` declaration appears; it can be quite confusing. It's much more common and accepted to use *hoisted* function declarations, as we do with the `foo()` call appearing before its formal declaration.

Nested Scopes~
When you declare a variable, it is available anywhere in that scope, as well as any lower/inner scopes. For example:
>
  function foo() {
          var a = 1;
          function bar() {
                  var b = 2;
                  function baz() {
                          var c = 3;
                          console.log( a, b, c );	// 1 2 3
                  }
                  baz();
                  console.log( a, b );		// 1 2
          }
          bar();
          console.log( a );				// 1
  }
  foo();

Notice that `c` is not available inside of `bar()`, because it's declared only inside the inner `baz()` scope, and that `b` is not available to `foo()` for the same reason.
If you try to access a variable's value in a scope where it's not available, you'll get a `ReferenceError` thrown. If you try to set a variable that hasn't been declared, you'll either end up creating a variable in the top-level global scope (bad!) or getting an error, depending on "strict mode" (see "Strict Mode"). Let's take a look:
>
  function foo() {
          a = 1;	// `a` not formally declared
  }
  foo();
  a;			// 1 -- oops, auto global variable :(

This is a very bad practice. Don't do it! Always formally declare your variables.
In addition to creating declarations for variables at the function level, ES6 *lets* you declare variables to belong to individual blocks (pairs of `{ .. }`), using the `let` keyword. Besides some nuanced details, the scoping rules will behave roughly the same as we just saw with functions:
>
  function foo() {
          var a = 1;
          if (a >= 1) {
                  let b = 2;
                  while (b < 5) {
                          let c = b * 2;
                          b++;
                          console.log( a + c );
                  }
          }
  }
  foo();
  // 5 7 9

Because of using `let` instead of `var`, `b` will belong only to the `if` statement and thus not to the whole `foo()` function's scope. Similarly, `c` belongs only to the `while` loop. Block scoping is very useful for managing your variable scopes in a more fine-grained fashion, which can make your code much easier to maintain over time.
Note: For more information about scope, see the *Scope & Closures* title of this series. See the *ES6 & Beyond* title of this series for more information about `let` block scoping.

Conditionals~
In addition to the `if` statement we introduced briefly in Chapter 1, JavaScript provides a few other conditionals mechanisms that we should take a look at.
Sometimes you may find yourself writing a series of `if..else..if` statements like this:
>
  if (a == 2) {
          // do something
  }
  else if (a == 10) {
          // do another thing
  }
  else if (a == 42) {
          // do yet another thing
  }
  else {
          // fallback to here
  }

This structure works, but it's a little verbose because you need to specify the `a` test for each case. Here's another option, the `switch` statement:
>
  switch (a) {
          case 2:
                  // do something
                  break;
          case 10:
                  // do another thing
                  break;
          case 42:
                  // do yet another thing
                  break;
          default:
                  // fallback to here
  }

The `break` is important if you want only the statement(s) in one `case` to run. If you omit `break` from a `case`, and that `case` matches or runs, execution will continue with the next `case`'s statements regardless of that `case` matching. This so called "fall through" is sometimes useful/desired:
>
  switch (a) {
          case 2:
          case 10:
                  // some cool stuff
                  break;
          case 42:
                  // other stuff
                  break;
          default:
                  // fallback
  }

Here, if `a` is either `2` or `10`, it will execute the "some cool stuff" code statements.
Another form of conditional in JavaScript is the "conditional operator," often called the "ternary operator." It's like a more concise form of a single `if..else` statement, such as:
>
  var a = 42;
  var b = (a > 41) ? "hello" : "world";
  // similar to:
  // if (a > 41) {
  //    b = "hello";
  // }
  // else {
  //    b = "world";
  // }

If the test expression (`a > 41` here) evaluates as `true`, the first clause (`"hello"`) results, otherwise the second clause (`"world"`) results, and whatever the result is then gets assigned to `b`.
The conditional operator doesn't have to be used in an assignment, but that's definitely the most common usage.
Note: For more information about testing conditions and other patterns for `switch` and `? :`, see the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

Strict Mode~
ES5 added a "strict mode" to the language, which tightens the rules for certain behaviors. Generally, these restrictions are seen as keeping the code to a safer and more appropriate set of guidelines. Also, adhering to strict mode makes your code generally more optimizable by the engine. Strict mode is a big win for code, and you should use it for all your programs.
You can opt in to strict mode for an individual function, or an entire file, depending on where you put the strict mode pragma:
>
  function foo() {
          "use strict";
          // this code is strict mode
          function bar() {
                  // this code is strict mode
          }
  }
  // this code is not strict mode

Compare that to:
>
  "use strict";
  function foo() {
          // this code is strict mode
          function bar() {
                  // this code is strict mode
          }
  }
  // this code is strict mode

One key difference (improvement!) with strict mode is disallowing the implicit auto-global variable declaration from omitting the `var`:
>
  function foo() {
          "use strict";	// turn on strict mode
          a = 1;			// `var` missing, ReferenceError
  }
  foo();

If you turn on strict mode in your code, and you get errors, or code starts behaving buggy, your temptation might be to avoid strict mode. But that instinct would be a bad idea to indulge. If strict mode causes issues in your program, almost certainly it's a sign that you have things in your program you should fix.
Not only will strict mode keep your code to a safer path, and not only will it make your code more optimizable, but it also represents the future direction of the language. It'd be easier on you to get used to strict mode now than to keep putting it off -- it'll only get harder to convert later!
Note: For more information about strict mode, see the Chapter 5 of the *Types & Grammar* title of this series.

Functions As Values~
So far, we've discussed functions as the primary mechanism of *scope* in JavaScript. You recall typical `function` declaration syntax as follows:
>
  function foo() {
          // ..
  }

Though it may not seem obvious from that syntax, `foo` is basically just a variable in the outer enclosing scope that's given a reference to the `function` being declared. That is, the `function` itself is a value, just like `42` or `[1,2,3]` would be.
This may sound like a strange concept at first, so take a moment to ponder it. Not only can you pass a value (argument) *to* a function, but *a function itself can be a value* that's assigned to variables, or passed to or returned from other functions.
As such, a function value should be thought of as an expression, much like any other value or expression.
Consider:
>
  var foo = function() {
          // ..
  };
  var x = function bar(){
          // ..
  };

The first function expression assigned to the `foo` variable is called *anonymous* because it has no `name`.
The second function expression is *named* (`bar`), even as a reference to it is also assigned to the `x` variable. *Named function expressions* are generally more preferable, though *anonymous function expressions* are still extremely common.
For more information, see the *Scope & Closures* title of this series.

Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs)~
In the previous snippet, neither of the function expressions are executed -- we could if we had included `foo()` or `x()`, for instance.
There's another way to execute a function expression, which is typically referred to as an *immediately invoked function expression* (IIFE):
>
  (function IIFE(){
          console.log( "Hello!" );
  })();
  // "Hello!"

The outer `( .. )` that surrounds the `(function IIFE(){ .. })` function expression is just a nuance of JS grammar needed to prevent it from being treated as a normal function declaration.
The final `()` on the end of the expression -- the `})();` line -- is what actually executes the function expression referenced immediately before it.
That may seem strange, but it's not as foreign as first glance. Consider the similarities between `foo` and `IIFE` here:
>
  function foo() { .. }
  // `foo` function reference expression,
  // then `()` executes it
  foo();
  // `IIFE` function expression,
  // then `()` executes it
  (function IIFE(){ .. })();

As you can see, listing the `(function IIFE(){ .. })` before its executing `()` is essentially the same as including `foo` before its executing `()`; in both cases, the function reference is executed with `()` immediately after it.
Because an IIFE is just a function, and functions create variable *scope*, using an IIFE in this fashion is often used to declare variables that won't affect the surrounding code outside the IIFE:
>
  var a = 42;
  (function IIFE(){
          var a = 10;
          console.log( a );	// 10
  })();
  console.log( a );		// 42

  IIFEs can also have return values:
  >
  var x = (function IIFE(){
          return 42;
  })();
  x;	// 42

The `42` value gets `return`ed from the `IIFE`-named function being executed, and is then assigned to `x`.

Closure~
*Closure* is one of the most important, and often least understood, concepts in JavaScript. I won't cover it in deep detail here, and instead refer you to the *Scope & Closures* title of this series. But I want to say a few things about it so you understand the general concept. It will be one of the most important techniques in your JS skillset.
You can think of closure as a way to "remember" and continue to access a function's scope (its variables) even once the function has finished running.
Consider:
>
  function makeAdder(x) {
          // parameter `x` is an inner variable
          // inner function `add()` uses `x`, so
          // it has a "closure" over it
          function add(y) {
                  return y + x;
          };
          return add;
  }

The reference to the inner `add(..)` function that gets returned with each call to the outer `makeAdder(..)` is able to remember whatever `x` value was passed in to `makeAdder(..)`. Now, let's use `makeAdder(..)`:
>
  // `plusOne` gets a reference to the inner `add(..)`
  // function with closure over the `x` parameter of
  // the outer `makeAdder(..)`
  var plusOne = makeAdder( 1 );
  // `plusTen` gets a reference to the inner `add(..)`
  // function with closure over the `x` parameter of
  // the outer `makeAdder(..)`
  var plusTen = makeAdder( 10 );
  plusOne( 3 );		// 4  <-- 1 + 3
  plusOne( 41 );		// 42 <-- 1 + 41
  plusTen( 13 );		// 23 <-- 10 + 13

More on how this code works:
1. When we call `makeAdder(1)`, we get back a reference to its inner `add(..)` that remembers `x` as `1`. We call this function reference `plusOne(..)`.
2. When we call `makeAdder(10)`, we get back another reference to its inner `add(..)` that remembers `x` as `10`. We call this function reference `plusTen(..)`.
3. When we call `plusOne(3)`, it adds `3` (its inner `y`) to the `1` (remembered by `x`), and we get `4` as the result.
4. When we call `plusTen(13)`, it adds `13` (its inner `y`) to the `10` (remembered by `x`), and we get `23` as the result.
Don't worry if this seems strange and confusing at first -- it can be! It'll take lots of practice to understand it fully.
But trust me, once you do, it's one of the most powerful and useful techniques in all of programming. It's definitely worth the effort to let your brain simmer on closures for a bit. In the next section, we'll get a little more practice with closure.

Modules~
The most common usage of closure in JavaScript is the module pattern. Modules let you define private implementation details (variables, functions) that are hidden from the outside world, as well as a public API that *is* accessible from the outside.
Consider:
>
  function User(){
          var username, password;
          function doLogin(user,pw) {
                  username = user;
                  password = pw;
                  // do the rest of the login work
          }
          var publicAPI = {
                  login: doLogin
          };
          return publicAPI;
  }
  // create a `User` module instance
  var fred = User();
  fred.login( "fred", "12Battery34!" );

The `User()` function serves as an outer scope that holds the variables `username` and `password`, as well as the inner `doLogin()` function; these are all private inner details of this `User` module that cannot be accessed from the outside world.
Warning: We are not calling `new User()` here, on purpose, despite the fact that probably seems more common to most readers. `User()` is just a function, not a class to be instantiated, so it's just called normally. Using `new` would be inappropriate and actually waste resources.
Executing `User()` creates an *instance* of the `User` module -- a whole new scope is created, and thus a whole new copy of each of these inner variables/functions. We assign this instance to `fred`. If we run `User()` again, we'd get a new instance entirely separate from `fred`.
The inner `doLogin()` function has a closure over `username` and `password`, meaning it will retain its access to them even after the `User()` function finishes running.
`publicAPI` is an object with one property/method on it, `login`, which is a reference to the inner `doLogin()` function. When we return `publicAPI` from `User()`, it becomes the instance we call `fred`.
At this point, the outer `User()` function has finished executing. Normally, you'd think the inner variables like `username` and `password` have gone away. But here they have not, because there's a closure in the `login()` function keeping them alive.
That's why we can call `fred.login(..)` -- the same as calling the inner `doLogin(..)` -- and it can still access `username` and `password` inner variables.
There's a good chance that with just this brief glimpse at closure and the module pattern, some of it is still a bit confusing. That's OK! It takes some work to wrap your brain around it.
From here, go read the *Scope & Closures* title of this series for a much more in-depth exploration.

*this* Identifier~
Another very commonly misunderstood concept in JavaScript is the *this* identifier. Again, there's a couple of chapters on it in the *this & Object Prototypes* title of this series, so here we'll just briefly introduce the concept.
While it may often seem that *this* is related to "object-oriented patterns," in JS `this` is a different mechanism.
If a function has a *this* reference inside it, that `this` reference usually points to an `object`. But which `object` it points to depends on how the function was called.
It's important to realize that *this* *does not* refer to the function itself, as is the most common misconception.
Here's a quick illustration:
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.bar );
  }
  var bar = "global";
  var obj1 = {
          bar: "obj1",
          foo: foo
  };
  var obj2 = {
          bar: "obj2"
  };
  // --------
  foo();				// "global"
  obj1.foo();			// "obj1"
  foo.call( obj2 );		// "obj2"
  new foo();			// undefined

There are four rules for how *this* gets set, and they're shown in those last four lines of that snippet.
1. `foo()` ends up setting *this* to the global object in non-strict mode -- in strict mode, `this` would be `undefined` and you'd get an error in accessing the `bar` property -- so `"global"` is the value found for `this.bar`.
2. `obj1.foo()` sets *this* to the `obj1` object.
3. `foo.call(obj2)` sets *this* to the `obj2` object.
4. `new foo()` sets *this* to a brand new empty object.
Bottom line: to understand what *this* points to, you have to examine how the function in question was called. It will be one of those four ways just shown, and that will then answer what `this` is.
Note: For more information about *this*, see Chapters 1 and 2 of the *this & Object Prototypes* title of this series.

Prototypes~
The prototype mechanism in JavaScript is quite complicated. We will only glance at it here. You will want to spend plenty of time reviewing Chapters 4-6 of the *this & Object Prototypes* title of this series for all the details.
When you reference a property on an object, if that property doesn't exist, JavaScript will automatically use that object's internal prototype reference to find another object to look for the property on. You could think of this almost as a fallback if the property is missing.
The internal prototype reference linkage from one object to its fallback happens at the time the object is created. The simplest way to illustrate it is with a built-in utility called `Object.create(..)`.
Consider:
>
  var foo = {
          a: 42
  };
  // create `bar` and link it to `foo`
  var bar = Object.create( foo );
  bar.b = "hello world";
  bar.b;		// "hello world"
  bar.a;		// 42 <-- delegated to `foo`

It may help to visualize the `foo` and `bar` objects and their relationship:
The `a` property doesn't actually exist on the `bar` object, but because `bar` is prototype-linked to `foo`, JavaScript automatically falls back to looking for `a` on the `foo` object, where it's found.
This linkage may seem like a strange feature of the language. The most common way this feature is used -- and I would argue, abused -- is to try to emulate/fake a "class" mechanism with "inheritance."
But a more natural way of applying prototypes is a pattern called "behavior delegation," where you intentionally design your linked objects to be able to *delegate* from one to the other for parts of the needed behavior.
Note: For more information about prototypes and behavior delegation, see Chapters 4-6 of the *this & Object Prototypes* title of this series.

Old & New~
Some of the JS features we've already covered, and certainly many of the features covered in the rest of this series, are newer additions and will not necessarily be available in older browsers. In fact, some of the newest features in the specification aren't even implemented in any stable browsers yet.
So, what do you do with the new stuff? Do you just have to wait around for years or decades for all the old browsers to fade into obscurity?
That's how many people think about the situation, but it's really not a healthy approach to JS.
There are two main techniques you can use to "bring" the newer JavaScript stuff to the older browsers: polyfilling and transpiling.

Polyfilling~
The word "polyfill" is an invented term (by Remy Sharp) (https://remysharp.com/2010/10/08/what-is-a-polyfill) used to refer to taking the definition of a newer feature and producing a piece of code that's equivalent to the behavior, but is able to run in older JS environments.
For example, ES6 defines a utility called `Number.isNaN(..)` to provide an accurate non-buggy check for `NaN` values, deprecating the original `isNaN(..)` utility. But it's easy to polyfill that utility so that you can start using it in your code regardless of whether the end user is in an ES6 browser or not.
Consider:
>
  if (!Number.isNaN) {
          Number.isNaN = function isNaN(x) {
                  return x !== x;
          };
  }

The `if` statement guards against applying the polyfill definition in ES6 browsers where it will already exist. If it's not already present, we define `Number.isNaN(..)`.
Note: The check we do here takes advantage of a quirk with `NaN` values, which is that they're the only value in the whole language that is not equal to itself. So the `NaN` value is the only one that would make `x !== x` be `true`.
Not all new features are fully polyfillable. Sometimes most of the behavior can be polyfilled, but there are still small deviations. You should be really, really careful in implementing a polyfill yourself, to make sure you are adhering to the specification as strictly as possible.
Or better yet, use an already vetted set of polyfills that you can trust, such as those provided by ES5-Shim (https://github.com/es-shims/es5-shim) and ES6-Shim (https://github.com/es-shims/es6-shim).

Transpiling~
There's no way to polyfill new syntax that has been added to the language. The new syntax would throw an error in the old JS engine as unrecognized/invalid.
So the better option is to use a tool that converts your newer code into older code equivalents. This process is commonly called "transpiling," a term for transforming + compiling.
Essentially, your source code is authored in the new syntax form, but what you deploy to the browser is the transpiled code in old syntax form. You typically insert the transpiler into your build process, similar to your code linter or your minifier.
You might wonder why you'd go to the trouble to write new syntax only to have it transpiled away to older code -- why not just write the older code directly?
There are several important reasons you should care about transpiling:
* The new syntax added to the language is designed to make your code more readable and maintainable. The older equivalents are often much more convoluted. You should prefer writing newer and cleaner syntax, not only for yourself but for all other members of the development team.
* If you transpile only for older browsers, but serve the new syntax to the newest browsers, you get to take advantage of browser performance optimizations with the new syntax. This also lets browser makers have more real-world code to test their implementations and optimizations on.
* Using the new syntax earlier allows it to be tested more robustly in the real world, which provides earlier feedback to the JavaScript committee (TC39). If issues are found early enough, they can be changed/fixed before those language design mistakes become permanent.
Here's a quick example of transpiling. ES6 adds a feature called "default parameter values." It looks like this:
>
  function foo(a = 2) {
          console.log( a );
  }
  foo();		// 2
  foo( 42 );	// 42

  Simple, right? Helpful, too! But it's new syntax that's invalid in pre-ES6 engines. So what will a transpiler do with that code to make it run in older environments?
  >
  function foo() {
          var a = arguments[0] !== (void 0) ? arguments[0] : 2;
          console.log( a );
  }

As you can see, it checks to see if the `arguments[0]` value is `void 0` (aka `undefined`), and if so provides the `2` default value; otherwise, it assigns whatever was passed.
In addition to being able to now use the nicer syntax even in older browsers, looking at the transpiled code actually explains the intended behavior more clearly.
You may not have realized just from looking at the ES6 version that `undefined` is the only value that can't get explicitly passed in for a default-value parameter, but the transpiled code makes that much more clear.
The last important detail to emphasize about transpilers is that they should now be thought of as a standard part of the JS development ecosystem and process. JS is going to continue to evolve, much more quickly than before, so every few months new syntax and new features will be added.
If you use a transpiler by default, you'll always be able to make that switch to newer syntax whenever you find it useful, rather than always waiting for years for today's browsers to phase out.
There are quite a few great transpilers for you to choose from. Here are some good options at the time of this writing:
* Babel (https://babeljs.io) (formerly 6to5): Transpiles ES6+ into ES5
* Traceur (https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler): Transpiles ES6, ES7, and beyond into ES5

Non-JavaScript~
So far, the only things we've covered are in the JS language itself. The reality is that most JS is written to run in and interact with environments like browsers. A good chunk of the stuff that you write in your code is, strictly speaking, not directly controlled by JavaScript. That probably sounds a little strange.
The most common non-JavaScript JavaScript you'll encounter is the DOM API. For example:
>
  var el = document.getElementById( "foo" );

The `document` variable exists as a global variable when your code is running in a browser. It's not provided by the JS engine, nor is it particularly controlled by the JavaScript specification. It takes the form of something that looks an awful lot like a normal JS `object`, but it's not really exactly that. It's a special `object,` often called a "host object."
Moreover, the `getElementById(..)` method on `document` looks like a normal JS function, but it's just a thinly exposed interface to a built-in method provided by the DOM from your browser. In some (newer-generation) browsers, this layer may also be in JS, but traditionally the DOM and its behavior is implemented in something more like C/C++.
Another example is with input/output (I/O).
Everyone's favorite `alert(..)` pops up a message box in the user's browser window. `alert(..)` is provided to your JS program by the browser, not by the JS engine itself. The call you make sends the message to the browser internals and it handles drawing and displaying the message box.
The same goes with `console.log(..)`; your browser provides such mechanisms and hooks them up to the developer tools.
This book, and this whole series, focuses on JavaScript the language. That's why you don't see any substantial coverage of these non-JavaScript JavaScript mechanisms. Nevertheless, you need to be aware of them, as they'll be in every JS program you write!

Review~
The first step to learning JavaScript's flavor of programming is to get a basic understanding of its core mechanisms like values, types, function closures, *this*, and prototypes.
Of course, each of these topics deserves much greater coverage than you've seen here, but that's why they have chapters and books dedicated to them throughout the rest of this series. After you feel pretty comfortable with the concepts and code samples in this chapter, the rest of the series awaits you to really dig in and get to know the language deeply.
The final chapter of this book will briefly summarize each of the other titles in the series and the other concepts they cover besides what we've already explored.

BOOK 3                                                   *this&ObjectPrototypes*

CHAPTER 1                                                         *thisOrThat*
this or that? ~

One of the most confused mechanisms in JavaScript is the *this* keyword. It's a special identifier keyword that's automatically defined in the scope of every function, but what exactly it refers to bedevils even seasoned JavaScript developers.

  Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. -- Arthur C. Clarke ~

JavaScript's *this* mechanism isn't actually *that* advanced, but developers often paraphrase that quote in their own mind by inserting "complex" or "confusing", and there's no question that without lack of clear understanding, `this` can seem downright magical in *your* confusion.
Note: The word "this" is a terribly common pronoun in general discourse. So, it can be very difficult, especially verbally, to determine whether we are using "this" as a pronoun or using it to refer to the actual keyword identifier. For clarity, I will always use *this* to refer to the special keyword, and "this" or *this* or this otherwise.

Why this? ~
If the *this* mechanism is so confusing, even to seasoned JavaScript developers, one may wonder why it's even useful? Is it more trouble than it's worth? Before we jump into the *how,* we should examine the *why.*
Let's try to illustrate the motivation and utility of *this:*
  >
  function identify() {
          return this.name.toUpperCase();
  }

  function speak() {
          var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify.call( this );
          console.log( greeting );
  }

  
  var me = {
          name: "Kyle"
  };


  var you = {
          name: "Reader"
  };

  identify.call( me ); // KYLE
  identify.call( you ); // READER
  speak.call( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE
  speak.call( you ); // Hello, I'm READER
  

If the *how* of this snippet confuses you, don't worry! We'll get to that shortly. Just set those questions aside briefly so we can look into the *why* more clearly.
This code snippet allows the  ( *this* ) objects, rather than needing a separate version of the function for each object.
Instead of relying on *this.*
>
  function identify(context) {
          return context.name.toUpperCase();
  }

  function speak(context) {
          var greeting = "Hello, I'm " + identify( context );
          console.log( greeting );
  }

  identify( you ); // READER
  speak( me ); // Hello, I'm KYLE

However, the *this* mechanism provides a more elegant way of implicitly "passing along" an object reference, leading to cleaner API design and easier re-use.
The more complex your usage pattern is, the more clearly you'll see that passing context around as an explicit parameter is often messier than passing around a *this* context. When we explore objects and prototypes, you will see the helpfulness of a collection of functions being able to automatically reference the proper context object.

Confusions ~
We'll soon begin to explain how *this* *actually* works, but first we must  dispel some misconceptions about how it *doesn't* actually work.
The name "this" creates confusion when developers try to think about it too literally. There are two meanings often assumed, but both are incorrect.

Itself ~
The first common temptation is to assume *this* refers to the function itself. That's a reasonable grammatical inference, at least.
Why would you want to refer to a function from inside itself? The most common reasons would be things like recursion (calling a function from inside itself) or having an event handler that can unbind itself when it's first called.
Developers new to JS's mechanisms often think that referencing the function as an object (all functions in JavaScript are objects!) lets you store *state* (values in properties) between function calls. While this is certainly possible and has some limited uses, the rest of the book will expound on many other patterns for *better* places to store state besides the function object.
But for just a moment, we'll explore that pattern, to illustrate how *this* doesn't let a function get a reference to itself like we might have assumed.
Consider the following code, where we attempt to track how many times a function ( *this* ) was called:
  >
  function foo(num) {
          console.log( "foo: " + num );

          // keep track of how many times *this* is called
          this.count++;
  }

  foo.count = 0;

  var i;

  for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
          if (i > 5) {
                  foo( i );
          }
  }
  // foo: 6
  // foo: 7
  // foo: 8
  // foo: 9

  // how many times was *this* called?
  console.log( foo.count ); // 0 -- WTF?

`foo.count` is *still* `0`, even though the four `console.log` statements clearly indicate `foo(..)` was in fact called four times. The frustration stems from a *too* *literal* interpretation of what *this* (in `this.count++`) means.
When the code executes *this* is not in fact pointing *at* *all* to that function object, and so even though the property names are the same, the root objects are different, and confusion ensues.
Note: A responsible developer *should* ask at this point, "If I was incrementing a *this* *was* I incrementing?" In fact, were she to dig deeper, she would find that she had accidentally created a global variable `count` (see Chapter 2 for *how* that happened!), and it currently has the value `NaN`. Of course, once she identifies this peculiar outcome, she then has a whole other set of questions: "How was it global, and why did it end up `NaN` instead of some proper count value?" (see Chapter 2).
Instead of stopping at this point and digging into why the *this* property:
>
  function foo(num) {
          console.log( "foo: " + num );

          // keep track of how many times *this* is called
          data.count++;
  }

  var data = {
          count: 0
  };

  var i;

  for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
          if (i > 5) {
                  foo( i );
          }
  }
  // foo: 6
  // foo: 7
  // foo: 8
  // foo: 9

  // how many times was 'this' called?
  console.log( data.count ); // 4
<
While it is true that this approach "solves" the problem, unfortunately it simply ignores the real problem -- lack of understanding what *this* means and how it works -- and instead falls back to the comfort zone of a more familiar mechanism: lexical scope.
Note: Lexical scope is a perfectly fine and useful mechanism; I am not belittling the use of it, by any means (see Scope & Closures title of this book series). But constantly *guessing* at how to use *this* eludes you.
To reference a function object from inside itself, *this* by itself will typically be insufficient. You generally need a reference to the function object via a lexical identifier (variable) that points at it.
Consider these two functions:
>
  function foo() {
          foo.count = 4; // *this* refers to itself
  }

  setTimeout( function(){
          // anonymous function (no name), cannot
          // refer to itself
  }, 10 );
<

In the first function, called a "named function", *this* is a reference that can be used to refer to the function from inside itself.
But in the second example, the function callback passed to *this* has no name identifier (so called an "anonymous function"), so there's no proper way to refer to the function object itself.
Note: The old-school but now deprecated and frowned-upon *this* is deprecated and should not be used.
So another solution to our running example would have been to use the *this* at all, which *works:*
>
  function foo(num) {
          console.log( "foo: " + num );

          // keep track of how many times *this* is called
          foo.count++;
  }

  foo.count = 0;

  var i;

  for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
          if (i > 5) {
                  foo( i );
          }
  }
  // foo: 6
  // foo: 7
  // foo: 8
  // foo: 9

  // how many times was 'this' called?
  console.log( foo.count ); // 4

However, that approach similarly side-steps *actual* understanding of *this.*
Yet another way of approaching the issue is to force *this* function object:
>
  function foo(num) {
          console.log( "foo: " + num );

          // keep track of how many times *this* is called
          // Note: *this* now, based on
          // how *this* is called (see below)
          this.count++;
  }

  foo.count = 0;

  var i;

  for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
          if (i > 5) {
                  // using *this*
                  // points at the function object (*this*) itself
                  foo.call( foo, i );
          }
  }
  // foo: 6
  // foo: 7
  // foo: 8
  // foo: 9

  // how many times was *this* called?
  console.log( foo.count ); // 4
<
Instead of avoiding *this,* we embrace it. We'll explain in a little bit *how* such techniques work much more completely, so don't worry if you're still a bit confused!

Its Scope ~
The next most common misconception about the meaning of *this* is that it somehow refers to the function's scope. It's a tricky question, because in one sense there is some truth, but in the other sense, it's quite misguided.
To be clear, *this* does not, in any way, refer to a function's *lexical* *scope.* It is true that internally, scope is kind of like an object with properties for each of the available identifiers. But the scope "object" is not accessible to JavaScript code. It's an inner part of the *Engine's* implementation.
Consider code which attempts (and fails!) to cross over the boundary and use *this* to implicitly refer to a function's lexical scope:
>
  function foo() {
          var a = 2;
          this.bar();
  }

  function bar() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  foo(); //undefined

There's more than one mistake in this snippet. While it may seem contrived, the code you see is a distillation of actual real-world code that has been exchanged in public community help forums. It's a wonderful (if not sad) illustration of just how misguided *this* assumptions can be.
Firstly, an attempt is made to reference the *this* and just make a lexical reference to the identifier.
However, the developer who writes such code is attempting to use *this* reference to look something up in a lexical scope. It is not possible.
Every time you feel yourself trying to mix lexical scope look-ups with *this,* remind yourself: *there* *is* *no* *bridge.*

What's this? ~
Having set aside various incorrect assumptions, let us now turn our attention to how the *this* mechanism really works.
We said earlier that *this* binding has nothing to do with where a function is declared, but has instead everything to do with the manner in which the function is called.
When a function is invoked, an activation record, otherwise known as an execution context, is created. This record contains information about where the function was called from (the call-stack), *how* the function was invoked, what parameters were passed, etc. One of the properties of this record is the *this* reference which will be used for the duration of that function's execution.
In the next chapter, we will learn to find a function's *call-site* to determine how its execution will bind *this.*

Review (TL;DR) ~
*this* mechanism.
To learn *this* is neither a reference to the function itself, nor is it a reference to the function's *lexical* scope.
*this* is actually a binding that is made when a function is invoked, and *what* it references is determined entirely by the call-site where the function is called.



CHAPTER 2                                                                 *thisAllMakesSenseNow*
this All Makes Sense Now!~


In Chapter 1, we discarded various misconceptions about `this` and learned instead that `this` is a binding made for each function invocation, based entirely on its **call-site** (how the function is called).

Call-site~
To understand `this` binding, we have to understand the call-site: the location in code where a function is called (**not where it's declared**). We must inspect the call-site to answer the question: what's *this* `this` a reference to?
Finding the call-site is generally: "go locate where a function is called from", but it's not always that easy, as certain coding patterns can obscure the *true* call-site.
What's important is to think about the **call-stack** (the stack of functions that have been called to get us to the current moment in execution). The call-site we care about is *in* the invocation *before* the currently executing function.
Let's demonstrate call-stack and call-site:
>
  function baz() {
      // call-stack is: `baz`
      // so, our call-site is in the global scope

      console.log( "baz" );
      bar(); // <-- call-site for `bar`
  }

  function bar() {
      // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar`
      // so, our call-site is in `baz`

      console.log( "bar" );
      foo(); // <-- call-site for `foo`
  }

  function foo() {
      // call-stack is: `baz` -> `bar` -> `foo`
      // so, our call-site is in `bar`

      console.log( "foo" );
  }

  baz(); // <-- call-site for `baz`

Take care when analyzing code to find the actual call-site (from the call-stack), because it's the only thing that matters for `this` binding.
Note: You can visualize a call-stack in your mind by looking at the chain of function calls in order, as we did with the comments in the above snippet. But this is painstaking and error-prone. Another way of seeing the call-stack is using a debugger tool in your browser. Most modern desktop browsers have built-in developer tools, which includes a JS debugger. In the above snippet, you could have set a breakpoint in the tools for the first line of the `foo()` function, or simply inserted the `debugger;` statement on that first line. When you run the page, the debugger will pause at this location, and will show you a list of the functions that have been called to get to that line, which will be your call stack. So, if you're trying to diagnose `this` binding, use the developer tools to get the call-stack, then find the second item from the top, and that will show you the real call-site.

Nothing But Rules~
We turn our attention now to *how* the call-site determines where `this` will point during the execution of a function.
You must inspect the call-site and determine which of 4 rules applies. We will first explain each of these 4 rules independently, and then we will illustrate their order of precedence, if multiple rules *could* apply to the call-site.

Default Binding~
The first rule we will examine comes from the most common case of function calls: standalone function invocation. Think of *this* `this` rule as the default catch-all rule when none of the other rules apply.
Consider this code:

>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var a = 2;

  foo(); // 2

The first thing to note, if you were not already aware, is that variables declared in the global scope, as `var a = 2` is, are synonymous with global-object properties of the same name. They're not copies of each other, they *are* each other. Think of it as two sides of the same coin.
Secondly, we see that when `foo()` is called, `this.a` resolves to our global variable `a`. Why? Because in this case, the *default binding* for `this` applies to the function call, and so points `this` at the global object.
How do we know that the *default binding* rule applies here? We examine the call-site to see how `foo()` is called. In our snippet, `foo()` is called with a plain, un-decorated function reference. None of the other rules we will demonstrate will apply here, so the *default binding* applies instead.
If `strict mode` is in effect, the global object is not eligible for the *default binding*, so the `this` is instead set to `undefined`.

>
  function foo() {
          "use strict";

          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var a = 2;

  foo(); // TypeError: `this` is `undefined`

A subtle but important detail is: even though the overall `this` binding rules are entirely based on the call-site, the global object is **only** eligible for the *default binding* if the **contents** of `foo()` are **not** running in `strict mode`; the `strict mode` state of the call-site of `foo()` is irrelevant.
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var a = 2;

  (function(){
          "use strict";

          foo(); // 2
  })();

Note: Intentionally mixing `strict mode` and non-`strict mode` together in your own code is generally frowned upon. Your entire program should probably either be **Strict** or **non-Strict**. However, sometimes you include a third-party library that has different **Strict**'ness than your own code, so care must be taken over these subtle compatibility details.

Implicit Binding~
Another rule to consider is: does the call-site have a context object, also referred to as an owning or containing object, though *these* alternate terms could be slightly misleading.
Consider:
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2,
          foo: foo
  };

  obj.foo(); // 2

Firstly, notice the manner in which `foo()` is declared and then later added as a reference property onto `obj`. Regardless of whether `foo()` is initially declared *on* `obj`, or is added as a reference later (as this snippet shows), in neither case is the **function** really "owned" or "contained" by the `obj` object.
However, the call-site *uses* the `obj` context to **reference** the function, so you *could* say that the `obj` object "owns" or "contains" the **function reference** at the time the function is called.
Whatever you choose to call this pattern, at the point that `foo()` is called, it's preceded by an object reference to `obj`. When there is a context object for a function reference, the *implicit binding* rule says that it's *that* object which should be used for the function call's `this` binding.
Because `obj` is the `this` for the `foo()` call, `this.a` is synonymous with `obj.a`.
Only the top/last level of an object property reference chain matters to the call-site. For instance:

>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj2 = {
          a: 42,
          foo: foo
  };

  var obj1 = {
          a: 2,
          obj2: obj2
  };

  obj1.obj2.foo(); // 42

Implicitly Lost~
One of the most common frustrations that `this` binding creates is when an *implicitly bound* function loses that binding, which usually means it falls back to the *default binding*, of either the global object or `undefined`, depending on `strict mode`.
Consider:

>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2,
          foo: foo
  };

  var bar = obj.foo; // function reference/alias!

  var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

  bar(); // "oops, global"

Even though `bar` appears to be a reference to `obj.foo`, in fact, it's really just another reference to `foo` itself. Moreover, the call-site is what matters, and the call-site is `bar()`, which is a plain, un-decorated call and thus the *default binding* applies.
The more subtle, more common, and more unexpected way this occurs is when we consider passing a callback function:
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  function doFoo(fn) {
          // `fn` is just another reference to `foo`

          fn(); // <-- call-site!
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2,
          foo: foo
  };

  var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

  doFoo( obj.foo ); // "oops, global"

Parameter passing is just an implicit assignment, and since we're passing a function, it's an implicit reference assignment, so the end result is the same as the previous snippet.
What if the function you're passing your callback to is not your own, but built-in to the language? No difference, same outcome.
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2,
          foo: foo
  };

  var a = "oops, global"; // `a` also property on global object

  setTimeout( obj.foo, 100 ); // "oops, global"

Think about this crude theoretical pseudo-implementation of `setTimeout()` provided as a built-in from the JavaScript environment:
>
  function setTimeout(fn,delay) {
          // wait (somehow) for `delay` milliseconds
          fn(); // <-- call-site!
  }

It's quite common that our function callbacks *lose* their `this` binding, as we've just seen. But another way that `this` can surprise us is when the function we've passed our callback to intentionally changes the `this` for the call. Event handlers in popular JavaScript libraries are quite fond of forcing your callback to have a `this` which points to, for instance, the DOM element that triggered the event. While that may sometimes be useful, other times it can be downright infuriating. Unfortunately, these tools rarely let you choose.
Either way the `this` is changed unexpectedly, you are not really in control of how your callback function reference will be executed, so you have no way (yet) of controlling the call-site to give your intended binding. We'll see shortly a way of "fixing" that problem by *fixing* the `this`.

Explicit Binding~
With *implicit binding* as we just saw, we had to mutate the object in question to include a reference on itself to the function, and use this property function reference to indirectly (implicitly) bind `this` to the object.
But, what if you want to force a function call to use a particular object for the `this` binding, without putting a property function reference on the object?
"All" functions in the language have some utilities available to them (via their `[[Prototype]]` -- more on that later) which can be useful for this task. Specifically, functions have `call(..)` and `apply(..)` methods. Technically, JavaScript host environments sometimes provide functions which are special enough (a kind way of putting it!) that they do not have such functionality. But those are few. The vast majority of functions provided, and certainly all functions you will create, do have access to `call(..)` and `apply(..)`.
How do these utilities work? They both take, as their first parameter, an object to use for the `this`, and then invoke the function with that `this` specified. Since you are directly stating what you want the `this` to be, we call it *explicit binding*.
Consider:
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2
  };

  foo.call( obj ); // 2

Invoking `foo` with *explicit binding* by `foo.call(..)` allows us to force its `this` to be `obj`.
If you pass a simple primitive value (of type `string`, `boolean`, or `number`) as the `this` binding, the primitive value is wrapped in its object-form (`new String(..)`, `new Boolean(..)`, or `new Number(..)`, respectively). This is often referred to as "boxing".
Note: With respect to `this` binding, `call(..)` and `apply(..)` are identical. They *do* behave differently with their additional parameters, but that's not something we care about presently.
Unfortunately, *explicit binding* alone still doesn't offer any solution to the issue mentioned previously, of a function "losing" its intended `this` binding, or just having it paved over by a framework, etc.

Hard Binding~
But a variation pattern around *explicit binding* actually does the trick. Consider:
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2
  };

  var bar = function() {
          foo.call( obj );
  };

  bar(); // 2
  setTimeout( bar, 100 ); // 2

  // `bar` hard binds `foo`'s `this` to `obj`
  // so that it cannot be overriden
  bar.call( window ); // 2

Let's examine how this variation works. We create a function `bar()` which, internally, manually calls `foo.call(obj)`, thereby forcibly invoking `foo` with `obj` binding for `this`. No matter how you later invoke the function `bar`, it will always manually invoke `foo` with `obj`. This binding is both explicit and strong, so we call it *hard binding*.
The most typical way to wrap a function with a *hard binding* creates a pass-thru of any arguments passed and any return value received:
>
  function foo(something) {
          console.log( this.a, something );
          return this.a + something;
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2
  };

  var bar = function() {
          return foo.apply( obj, arguments );
  };

  var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
  console.log( b ); // 5

Another way to express this pattern is to create a re-usable helper:
>
  function foo(something) {
          console.log( this.a, something );
          return this.a + something;
  }

  // simple `bind` helper
  function bind(fn, obj) {
          return function() {
                  return fn.apply( obj, arguments );
          };
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2
  };

  var bar = bind( foo, obj );

  var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
  console.log( b ); // 5

Since *hard binding* is such a common pattern, it's provided with a built-in utility as of ES5: `Function.prototype.bind`, and it's used like this:
>
  function foo(something) {
          console.log( this.a, something );
          return this.a + something;
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2
  };

  var bar = foo.bind( obj );

  var b = bar( 3 ); // 2 3
  console.log( b ); // 5

`bind(..)` returns a new function that is hard-coded to call the original function with the `this` context set as you specified.
Note: As of ES6, the hard-bound function produced by `bind(..)` has a `.name` property that derives from the original *target function*. For example: `bar = foo.bind(..)` should have a `bar.name` value of `"bound foo"`, which is the function call name that should show up in a stack trace.

API Call "Contexts"~
Many libraries' functions, and indeed many new built-in functions in the JavaScript language and host environment, provide an optional parameter, usually called "context", which is designed as a work-around for you not having to use `bind(..)` to ensure your callback function uses a particular `this`.
For instance:
>
  function foo(el) {
          console.log( el, this.id );
  }

  var obj = {
          id: "awesome"
  };

  // use `obj` as `this` for `foo(..)` calls
  [1, 2, 3].forEach( foo, obj ); // 1 awesome  2 awesome  3 awesome

Internally, these various functions almost certainly use *explicit binding* via `call(..)` or `apply(..)`, saving you the trouble.

new Binding~
The fourth and final rule for `this` binding requires us to re-think a very common misconception about functions and objects in JavaScript.
In traditional class-oriented languages, "constructors" are special methods attached to classes, that when the class is instantiated with a `new` operator, the constructor of that class is called. This usually looks something like:
>
  something = new MyClass(..);

JavaScript has a `new` operator, and the code pattern to use it looks basically identical to what we see in those class-oriented languages; most developers assume that JavaScript's mechanism is doing something similar. However, there really is *no connection* to class-oriented functionality implied by `new` usage in JS.
First, let's re-define what a "constructor" in JavaScript is. In JS, constructors are **just functions** that happen to be called with the `new` operator in front of them. They are not attached to classes, nor are they instantiating a class. They are not even special types of functions. They're just regular functions that are, in essence, hijacked by the use of `new` in their invocation.
For example, the `Number(..)` function acting as a constructor, quoting from the ES5.1 spec:

  > 15.7.2 The Number Constructor
  > When Number is called as part of a new expression it is a constructor: it initialises the newly created object.

So, pretty much any ol' function, including the built-in object functions like `Number(..)` (see Chapter 3) can be called with `new` in front of it, and that makes that function call a *constructor call*. This is an important but subtle distinction: there's really no such thing as "constructor functions", but rather construction calls *of* functions.
When a function is invoked with `new` in front of it, otherwise known as a constructor call, the following things are done automatically:
  1. a brand new object is created (aka, constructed) out of thin air
  2. *the newly constructed object is `[[Prototype]]`-linked*
  3. the newly constructed object is set as the `this` binding for that function call
  4. unless the function returns its own alternate **object**, the `new`-invoked function call will *automatically* return the newly constructed object.

Steps 1, 3, and 4 apply to our current discussion. We'll skip over step 2 for now and come back to it in Chapter 5.
Consider this code:
>
  function foo(a) {
          this.a = a;
  }

  var bar = new foo( 2 );
  console.log( bar.a ); // 2

By calling `foo(..)` with `new` in front of it, we've constructed a new object and set that new object as the `this` for the call of `foo(..)`. **So `new` is the final way that a function call's `this` can be bound.** We'll call this *new binding*.

Everything In Order~
So, now we've uncovered the 4 rules for binding `this` in function calls. *All* you need to do is find the call-site and inspect it to see which rule applies. But, what if the call-site has multiple eligible rules? There must be an order of precedence to these rules, and so we will next demonstrate what order to apply the rules.
It should be clear that the *default binding* is the lowest priority rule of the 4. So we'll just set that one aside.
Which is more precedent, *implicit binding* or *explicit binding*? Let's test it:
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var obj1 = {
          a: 2,
          foo: foo
  };

  var obj2 = {
          a: 3,
          foo: foo
  };

  obj1.foo(); // 2
  obj2.foo(); // 3

  obj1.foo.call( obj2 ); // 3
  obj2.foo.call( obj1 ); // 2

So, *explicit binding* takes precedence over *implicit binding*, which means you should ask **first** if *explicit binding* applies before checking for *implicit binding*.
Now, we just need to figure out where *new binding* fits in the precedence.
>
  function foo(something) {
          this.a = something;
  }

  var obj1 = {
          foo: foo
  };

  var obj2 = {};

  obj1.foo( 2 );
  console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

  obj1.foo.call( obj2, 3 );
  console.log( obj2.a ); // 3

  var bar = new obj1.foo( 4 );
  console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
  console.log( bar.a ); // 4

OK, *new binding* is more precedent than *implicit binding*. But do you think *new binding* is more or less precedent than *explicit binding*?
Note: `new` and `call`/`apply` cannot be used together, so `new foo.call(obj1)` is not allowed, to test *new binding* directly against *explicit binding*. But we can still use a *hard binding* to test the precedence of the two rules.
Before we explore that in a code listing, think back to how *hard binding* physically works, which is that `Function.prototype.bind(..)` creates a new wrapper function that is hard-coded to ignore its own `this` binding (whatever it may be), and use a manual one we provide.
By that reasoning, it would seem obvious to assume that *hard binding* (which is a form of *explicit binding*) is more precedent than *new binding*, and thus cannot be overridden with `new`.
Let's check:

>
  function foo(something) {
          this.a = something;
  }

  var obj1 = {};

  var bar = foo.bind( obj1 );
  bar( 2 );
  console.log( obj1.a ); // 2

  var baz = new bar( 3 );
  console.log( obj1.a ); // 2
  console.log( baz.a ); // 3

Whoa! `bar` is hard-bound against `obj1`, but `new bar(3)` did **not** change `obj1.a` to be `3` as we would have expected. Instead, the *hard bound* (to `obj1`) call to `bar(..)` ***is*** able to be overridden with `new`. Since `new` was applied, we got the newly created object back, which we named `baz`, and we see in fact that  `baz.a` has the value `3`.
This should be surprising if you go back to our "fake" bind helper:
>
  function bind(fn, obj) {
          return function() {
                  fn.apply( obj, arguments );
          };
  }

If you reason about how the helper's code works, it does not have a way for a `new` operator call to override the hard-binding to `obj` as we just observed.
But the built-in `Function.prototype.bind(..)` as of ES5 is more sophisticated, quite a bit so in fact. Here is the (slightly reformatted) polyfill provided by the MDN page for `bind(..)`:
>
  if (!Function.prototype.bind) {
          Function.prototype.bind = function(oThis) {
                  if (typeof this !== "function") {
                          // closest thing possible to the ECMAScript 5
                          // internal IsCallable function
                          throw new TypeError( "Function.prototype.bind - what " +
                                  "is trying to be bound is not callable"
                          );
                  }

                  var aArgs = Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments, 1 ),
                          fToBind = this,
                          fNOP = function(){},
                          fBound = function(){
                                  return fToBind.apply(
                                          (
                                                  this instanceof fNOP &&
                                                  oThis ? this : oThis
                                          ),
                                          aArgs.concat( Array.prototype.slice.call( arguments ) )
                                  );
                          }
                  ;

                  fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
                  fBound.prototype = new fNOP();

                  return fBound;
          };
  }

Note: The `bind(..)` polyfill shown above differs from the built-in `bind(..)` in ES5 with respect to hard-bound functions that will be used with `new` (see below for why that's useful). Because the polyfill cannot create a function without a `.prototype` as the built-in utility does, there's some nuanced indirection to approximate the same behavior. Tread carefully if you plan to use `new` with a hard-bound function and you rely on this polyfill.
The part that's allowing `new` overriding is:
>
  this instanceof fNOP &&
  oThis ? this : oThis

  // ... and:

  fNOP.prototype = this.prototype;
  fBound.prototype = new fNOP();

We won't actually dive into explaining how this trickery works (it's complicated and beyond our scope here), but essentially the utility determines whether or not the hard-bound function has been called with `new` (resulting in a newly constructed object being its `this`), and if so, it uses *that* newly created `this` rather than the previously specified *hard binding* for `this`.
Why is `new` being able to override *hard binding* useful?
The primary reason for this behavior is to create a function (that can be used with `new` for constructing objects) that essentially ignores the `this` *hard binding* but which presets some or all of the function's arguments. One of the capabilities of `bind(..)` is that any arguments passed after the first `this` binding argument are defaulted as standard arguments to the underlying function (technically called "partial application", which is a subset of "currying").
For example:
>
  function foo(p1,p2) {
          this.val = p1 + p2;
  }

  // using `null` here because we don't care about
  // the `this` hard-binding in this scenario, and
  // it will be overridden by the `new` call anyway!
  var bar = foo.bind( null, "p1" );

  var baz = new bar( "p2" );

  baz.val; // p1p2

Determining this~
Now, we can summarize the rules for determining `this` from a function call's call-site, in their order of precedence. Ask these questions in this order, and stop when the first rule applies.
1. Is the function called with `new` (**new binding**)? If so, `this` is the newly constructed object.
    `var bar = new foo()`

2. Is the function called with `call` or `apply` (**explicit binding**), even hidden inside a `bind` *hard binding*? If so, `this` is the explicitly specified object.
    `var bar = foo.call( obj2 )`

3. Is the function called with a context (**implicit binding**), otherwise known as an owning or containing object? If so, `this` is *that* context object.
    `var bar = obj1.foo()`

4. Otherwise, default the `this` (**default binding**). If in `strict mode`, pick `undefined`, otherwise pick the `global` object.
    `var bar = foo()`

That's it. That's *all it takes* to understand the rules of `this` binding for normal function calls. Well... almost.

Binding Exceptions~
As usual, there are some *exceptions* to the "rules".
The `this`-binding behavior can in some scenarios be surprising, where you intended a different binding but you end up with binding behavior from the *default binding* rule (see previous).

Ignored this~
If you pass `null` or `undefined` as a `this` binding parameter to `call`, `apply`, or `bind`, those values are effectively ignored, and instead the *default binding* rule applies to the invocation.
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var a = 2;

  foo.call( null ); // 2

Why would you intentionally pass something like `null` for a `this` binding?
It's quite common to use `apply(..)` for spreading out arrays of values as parameters to a function call. Similarly, `bind(..)` can curry parameters (pre-set values), which can be very helpful.
>
  function foo(a,b) {
          console.log( "a:" + a + ", b:" + b );
  }

  // spreading out array as parameters
  foo.apply( null, [2, 3] ); // a:2, b:3

  // currying with `bind(..)`
  var bar = foo.bind( null, 2 );
  bar( 3 ); // a:2, b:3

Both these utilities require a `this` binding for the first parameter. If the functions in question don't care about `this`, you need a placeholder value, and `null` might seem like a reasonable choice as shown in this snippet.
Note: We don't cover it in this book, but ES6 has the `...` spread operator which will let you syntactically "spread out" an array as parameters without needing `apply(..)`, such as `foo(...[1,2])`, which amounts to `foo(1,2)` -- syntactically avoiding a `this` binding if it's unnecessary. Unfortunately, there's no ES6 syntactic substitute for currying, so the `this` parameter of the `bind(..)` call still needs attention.
However, there's a slight hidden "danger" in always using `null` when you don't care about the `this` binding. If you ever use that against a function call (for instance, a third-party library function that you don't control), and that function *does* make a `this` reference, the *default binding* rule means it might inadvertently reference (or worse, mutate!) the `global` object (`window` in the browser).
Obviously, such a pitfall can lead to a variety of *very difficult* to diagnose/track-down bugs.

Safer this~
Perhaps a somewhat "safer" practice is to pass a specifically set up object for `this` which is guaranteed not to be an object that can create problematic side effects in your program. Borrowing terminology from networking (and the military), we can create a "DMZ" (de-militarized zone) object -- nothing more special than a completely empty, non-delegated (see Chapters 5 and 6) object.
If we always pass a DMZ object for ignored `this` bindings we don't think we need to care about, we're sure any hidden/unexpected usage of `this` will be restricted to the empty object, which insulates our program's `global` object from side-effects.
Since this object is totally empty, I personally like to give it the variable name `ø` (the lowercase mathematical symbol for the empty set). On many keyboards (like US-layout on Mac), this symbol is easily typed with `⌥`+`o` (option+`o`). Some systems also let you set up hotkeys for specific symbols. If you don't like the `ø` symbol, or your keyboard doesn't make that as easy to type, you can of course call it whatever you want.
Whatever you call it, the easiest way to set it up as **totally empty** is `Object.create(null)` (see Chapter 5). `Object.create(null)` is similar to `{ }`, but without the delegation to `Object.prototype`, so it's "more empty" than just `{ }`.
>
  function foo(a,b) {
          console.log( "a:" + a + ", b:" + b );
  }

  // our DMZ empty object
  var ø = Object.create( null );

  // spreading out array as parameters
  foo.apply( ø, [2, 3] ); // a:2, b:3

  // currying with `bind(..)`
  var bar = foo.bind( ø, 2 );
  bar( 3 ); // a:2, b:3

Not only functionally "safer", there's a sort of stylistic benefit to `ø`, in that it semantically conveys "I want the `this` to be empty" a little more clearly than `null` might. But again, name your DMZ object whatever you prefer.

Indirection~
Another thing to be aware of is you can (intentionally or not!) create "indirect references" to functions, and in those cases,  when that function reference is invoked, the *default binding* rule also applies.
One of the most common ways that *indirect references* occur is from an assignment:
>
  function foo() {
          console.log( this.a );
  }

  var a = 2;
  var o = { a: 3, foo: foo };
  var p = { a: 4 };

  o.foo(); // 3
  (p.foo = o.foo)(); // 2

The *result value* of the assignment expression `p.foo = o.foo` is a reference to just the underlying function object. As such, the effective call-site is just `foo()`, not `p.foo()` or `o.foo()` as you might expect. Per the rules above, the *default binding* rule applies.
Reminder: regardless of how you get to a function invocation using the *default binding* rule, the `strict mode` status of the **contents** of the invoked function making the `this` reference -- not the function call-site -- determines the *default binding* value: either the `global` object if in non-`strict mode` or `undefined` if in `strict mode`.

Softening Binding~
We saw earlier that *hard binding* was one strategy for preventing a function call falling back to the *default binding* rule inadvertently, by forcing it to be bound to a specific `this` (unless you use `new` to override it!). The problem is, *hard-binding* greatly reduces the flexibility of a function, preventing manual `this` override with either the *implicit binding* or even subsequent *explicit binding* attempts.
It would be nice if there was a way to provide a different default for *default binding* (not `global` or `undefined`), while still leaving the function able to be manually `this` bound via *implicit binding* or *explicit binding* techniques.
We can construct a so-called *soft binding* utility which emulates our desired behavior.

          Function.prototype.softBind = function(obj) {

                                                          this === window) ||
                                                  (typeof global !== "undefined" &&
                                                          this === global)
                                          ) ? obj : this,
                                          curried.concat.apply( curried, arguments )
                                  );
                          };
                  bound.prototype = Object.create( fn.prototype );
                  return bound;
          };
  }

The `softBind(..)` utility provided here works similarly to the built-in ES5 `bind(..)` utility, except with our *soft binding* behavior. It wraps the specified function in logic that checks the `this` at call-time and if it's `global` or `undefined`, uses a pre-specified alternate *default* (`obj`). Otherwise the `this` is left untouched. It also provides optional currying (see the `bind(..)` discussion earlier).
Let's demonstrate its usage:
>
  function foo() {
     console.log("name: " + this.name);
  }

  var obj = { name: "obj" },
      obj2 = { name: "obj2" },
      obj3 = { name: "obj3" };

  var fooOBJ = foo.softBind( obj );

  fooOBJ(); // name: obj

  obj2.foo = foo.softBind(obj);
  obj2.foo(); // name: obj2   <---- look!!!

  fooOBJ.call( obj3 ); // name: obj3   <---- look!

  setTimeout( obj2.foo, 10 ); // name: obj   <---- falls back to soft-binding

The soft-bound version of the `foo()` function can be manually `this`-bound to `obj2` or `obj3` as shown, but it falls back to `obj` if the *default binding* would otherwise apply.

Lexical this~
Normal functions abide by the 4 rules we just covered. But ES6 introduces a special kind of function that does not use these rules: arrow-function.
Arrow-functions are signified not by the `function` keyword, but by the `=>` so called "fat arrow" operator. Instead of using the four standard `this` rules, arrow-functions adopt the `this` binding from the enclosing (function or global) scope.
Let's illustrate arrow-function lexical scope:
>
  function foo() {
          // return an arrow function
          return (a) => {
                  // `this` here is lexically adopted from `foo()`
                  console.log( this.a );
          };
  }

  var obj1 = {
          a: 2
  };

  var obj2 = {
          a: 3
  };

  var bar = foo.call( obj1 );
  bar.call( obj2 ); // 2, not 3!

The arrow-function created in `foo()` lexically captures whatever `foo()`s `this` is at its call-time. Since `foo()` was `this`-bound to `obj1`, `bar` (a reference to the returned arrow-function) will also be `this`-bound to `obj1`. The lexical binding of an arrow-function cannot be overridden (even with `new`!).
The most common use-case will likely be in the use of callbacks, such as event handlers or timers:
>
  function foo() {
          setTimeout(() => {
                  // `this` here is lexically adopted from `foo()`
                  console.log( this.a );
          },100);
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2
  };

  foo.call( obj ); // 2

While arrow-functions provide an alternative to using `bind(..)` on a function to ensure its `this`, which can seem attractive, it's important to note that they essentially are disabling the traditional `this` mechanism in favor of more widely-understood lexical scoping. Pre-ES6, we already have a fairly common pattern for doing so, which is basically almost indistinguishable from the spirit of ES6 arrow-functions:
>
  function foo() {
          var self = this; // lexical capture of `this`
          setTimeout( function(){
                  console.log( self.a );
          }, 100 );
  }

  var obj = {
          a: 2
  };

  foo.call( obj ); // 2

While `self = this` and arrow-functions both seem like good "solutions" to not wanting to use `bind(..)`, they are essentially fleeing from `this` instead of understanding and embracing it.
If you find yourself writing `this`-style code, but most or all the time, you defeat the `this` mechanism with lexical `self = this` or arrow-function "tricks", perhaps you should either:
1. Use only lexical scope and forget the false pretense of `this`-style code.
2. Embrace `this`-style mechanisms completely, including using `bind(..)` where necessary, and try to avoid `self = this` and arrow-function "lexical this" tricks.
A program can effectively use both styles of code (lexical and `this`), but inside of the same function, and indeed for the same sorts of look-ups, mixing the two mechanisms is usually asking for harder-to-maintain code, and probably working too hard to be clever.

Review (TL;DR)~
Determining the `this` binding for an executing function requires finding the direct call-site of that function. Once examined, four rules can be applied to the call-site, in *this* order of precedence:
1. Called with `new`? Use the newly constructed object.
2. Called with `call` or `apply` (or `bind`)? Use the specified object.
3. Called with a context object owning the call? Use that context object.
4. Default: `undefined` in `strict mode`, global object otherwise.
Be careful of accidental/unintentional invoking of the *default binding* rule. In cases where you want to "safely" ignore a `this` binding, a "DMZ" object like `ø = Object.create(null)` is a good placeholder value that protects the `global` object from unintended side-effects.
Instead of the four standard binding rules, ES6 arrow-functions use lexical scoping for `this` binding, which means they adopt the `this` binding (whatever it is) from its enclosing function call. They are essentially a syntactic replacement of `self = this` in pre-ES6 coding.
